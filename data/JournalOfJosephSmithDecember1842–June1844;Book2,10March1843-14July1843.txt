Book 2, 10 March–14 July 1843
Editorial Note
The second book of Willard Richards’s JS journal chronicles JS’s activities as church president, mayor of Nauvoo, Illinois, trustee-in-trust of the church, lieutenant general of the Nauvoo Legion, and businessman. The volume begins at 4:00 p.m. on 10 March 1843—the events of the earlier part of the day having been recorded in the first memorandum book—and continues through July 1843. This second book details JS’s involvement in numerous civic, legal, and ecclesiastical affairs and contains several accounts of his teachings. These accounts include comments made to Orson Hyde on 2 April that were later canonized; lengthy discourses delivered at the April 1843 “special Conference” of the Church; practical instructions given to newly arrived immigrants on 13 April; a discourse on resurrection given on 16 April; and instructions given to several members of the Quorum of the Twelve on 19 April. Other historically significant events mentioned are the calling of missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, JS and Emma Smith’s evident sealing, the recording of the revelation on eternal and plural marriage, JS’s plural marriage to Rhoda Richards (recorded in Taylor shorthand), and several lengthy discourses. At three different times during May and June 1843, JS left Nauvoo unaccompanied by Willard Richards. The first two trips (from 13 to 15 May and from 16 to 18 May) were relatively brief, and Richards wrote entries in the journal even in JS’s absence. The third trip (13–30 June), during which JS was arrested near Dixon, Illinois, on charges stemming from the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri, was lengthier. During this third period of JS’s absence, Richards generally either made no entry in the journal for a particular day or recorded what he heard or saw about JS’s arrest and efforts to rescue him. Several entries recorded after the Nauvoo Municipal Court discharged JS from arrest on 1 July illustrate the hostility that the rescue and release engendered among many non-Mormons in the area.

Editorial Note
Willard Richards, who was keeping JS’s journal at this time, did not accompany JS on his four-day trip to Ramus, Illinois, from 1 to 4 April 1843. Richards evidently reconstructed JS’s activities and teachings during this time for JS’s journal from the journal of William Clayton, who accompanied JS to Ramus, and from conversations with others who made the trip. As an important primary source for Richards’s information about JS’s activities between 1 and 4 April, Clayton’s journal entries for these dates are provided in full in Appendix 2.

after breakfast called on Sister Sophronia [Smith McCleary]—
10 A. M.— to meeting. Elder [Orson] Hyde Preached 1 epistle John 1. chap ist 3 verses— when he shall appear we shall be like. him93 &c. he will appear on a white horse.— as a warrior,94 & may be we shall have some of the same spirit.— our god is a warrior.— John. 14.23— it is our privilege to have the father & son dwelling in our hearts. &c [p. [35]]
95Cloudy. earth ½ covered with snow
96Elder Hyde remarked that he read in one of the newspapers— conceng [concerning] the passage of an act in one of the eastern states for to prohibit the citizens fr[o]m killing crows. bec[a]use they eat up all the filth & carrion from of[f] the earth.— thusly97 tending to preserve the hea[l]th of the people. but offer them a peice of clean fresh meat & a crow will not touch it for he has no appitite for it. he had often thought that there was a very great resemblance between the pri[e]sts of the day & these crows. for they were continually picking up all the dirt & filth & meanness of the mormons.— feasting on it if it was98 a precious morsel. but offer them any good and salutary <​from​> among— the mormns they have no appitite & will turn away from it
I think for the same reason the Legislature lets the crows live we ought to let the priests live gather up & eat up all the filth & rubbish from the mormon people that they may be healthy. [p. [36]]
99dined at Sophronia’s soon as he we arrived.— Elder Hyde I am going to offer some corrections to you. Elder H. repli[e]d— they shall be thankfully recieved.—100 When he shall appear we shall see him as he is. we shall see that he is a man like ourselves.—101 And that same sociality. which exists amogt [amongst] us here. will exist amo[n]g us there only it will be coupled with eternl glory which glory we do not now enjoy.
14 John 23.— the appearing of the father and of the Son in that verse is a personal. appearance.— to say that the father and the Son dwells in [p. [37]] a mans heart is an old Sectarian notion. and is not correct.
There is are no angels who administer to this earth but who belong to or have belongd to this earth. The angels do not reside on a planet like this earth. but they reside in the presence of God— but on a Globe like a sea of glass. & fire. “sea of glass before the throne.— &c.”102 where all things are manif[e]st past present & to come,—
The place where God resides is a great Urim And Thumim.
This earth in its sanctifid & immortal state. will be a Urim & Thummim for all things below it in the scale of creation. but not above it.— [p. [38]]
related the Dream. written on page 3d Book <​B​>103
Interpretati[o]n By O. Hyde— old man.— Govermnt of these Unitd States, who will be invaded by a foriegn foe. probably England. U. S. Goverment will call on Gen Smith to defend probably all this western territory and offer him any am[ou]nt of men he shall desire & put them under his command.
I prophecy in the Name of the Lord God that the commenceme[n]t of bloodshed as preparat[o]ry to the coming of the son of man. will commenc[e] in South Carolina.— (it probably may arise through the slave trade.)— this the a voice declard to me. while I was praying earne[s]tly on the subje[c]t 25 December 1832.—104 [p. [39]]
I earnestly desird to know concern[in]g the coming of the Son of Man & prayed. when— a voice said to me, Joseph, my, son, if thou livest until thou art 85 years old thou shalt see the facce of the son of man. therefore let this suffice & trouble me no more on this matter.—105
1. P. M. attended meeting.
Joseph read 5.th chapter of Johns revelation, referring particularly to the 6[th] verse. shewing from that. the a[c]tual existenc[e] of beasts in heaven probable those were beasts which had lived on another planet. than our’s—
God never made use of the figure of a beast to represent the kingdom of heaven.— Beasts. 7 eyes Pr[i]esthood.— [p. [40]]
this is the fi[r]st time I have ever taken a text in Revelati[o]n.— and if the young elders would let such things alone it would be far106 better.— then corrected Elder Hyde as in private.—
supped at Bro [Benjamin F.] Johnson’s.— expected to sta[r]t for Carthage, but bad weather prevntd [prevented] called another meeti[n]g. by bell.— read Rev[elation]— between Meeti[n]gs with Elder Hyde & expou[n]ding.— during this time several came in & expressd fear that I had come in contact with107 the old scripture
Meeting 7. eve resumd the subjct of the beast.— shewed very plainly that Johns vision was very different from Daniels Prophecy— one refering to things ex[is]ting in heaven. the other a figure of things on the which are on the earth.—108 [p. [41]]
whatever principle of inteligence we attain unto in this life. it will rise with us in the revalatin [revelation],109 and if a person gains more knowledge and intelignce. through his obedience & diligence. than another he will have so much the advantage in the world to come—
There is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven. before the foundation of the world upon which all blessings are predicated and when we obtain a blessing it is by obedi[e]nce to the law upon which that blessing is predicated.
again revertd to Elders Hyde mistake. &c the Father has a body of flesh & bones as tangible as mans110 [p. [42]] the Son also, but the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit.— and a person cannot have the personage <​of the H G. [Holy Ghost]​> in his heart he may recive the gift of the holy Ghost. it may descend upon him but not to tarry with him.—
What is the meaning of the scriptures. he that is faithful over a few thi[n]gs shall be made ruler over many? & he that is faithful over many shall be made ruler over many more?

Thursday, April 6,th 1843 The first day of the Jubilee,119 of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. a special Conference120 assembled of on the platform of the temple. or <​rough​> floor of the basement, at 10. o clock A.M.— the sun shone clearly. & was very warm & pleasant. scarce a speeck of snow was <​is​> to be seen <​except on the north side of Zarahemla Hill. is considerable​> but the ice was about 2 feet deep in the river west of the temple & north of that point; & south <​of that​> the channel is clear of ice,— the walls of the temple are from 4. to 12 feet above the floor. of the conference.—
President Joseph was detained by a court between in an action between [p. [48]] widow [Mercy Fielding] Thompson. vs. sister & Bro Dixon (from Salem) in assumpsit. & President B[righam] Young. took had charge of the meeting. & during the absence of President Joseph.— Quorum of the Twelve present. H[eber] C. Kimball O[rson] Pratt. W[ilford] Woodruff— John Taylor— Geo A Smith. W[illard] Richards. O. Hyde. ½ past 11. o clock—

10 <​mi[nutes]​> before 11. <​12​> President121 Joseph Smith & Elder [Sidney] Rigdon and O[rson] Hyde arrived.— the floor was about ¾ covered. with listeners— [p. [49]] 12 o clock— O. Pratt gave way & Joseph. rose to state the object of the meeting. It is my object to ascertain the stanig [standing] of the first presidency. (as I have been instructed122) I present myself for trial, I shall next present my councillors for trial.— 3d to take into consideration the sending out of the twelve <​or some porti[o]n of them​> or some body else to get means to build the up Nauvoo. House— & temple
4— Elders will have the privelige of appeals from the differce conferences to this if there are any such cases.— It is important that this conference [p. [50]] give importance to the N[auvoo] House. as a prejudice exists against the Nauvoo. House in favor of the Lords House——123
There is no place where men of wealth & character & influence can go to repose thimselves. and it is neccessary we should have such a place.
Are you satisfied with the first presedincy, so far as I am concerned, or will you choose another? If I have done any thing to injure my character in the sight of men & angels— or men & women. come forward tell of it. & if not ever after hold your peace. [p. [51]]
President B. Young arose & nominatd Joseph Smith to contin[u]e as our the Presdent. <​of the church​> Orson Hyde 2dd it.— Voted unanimously— Such a show of hands was never seen before in the church.— Joseph retur[ne]d his thanks—— to the assembly. & said he would serve them according to the best of his ability.
<​next president Joseph​> Brought forward Elder Rigdon for trial. Br Young nominated Elder Rigdon. to continue. 2d by O. Hyde Elder Rigdon. spoke, <​the​> last conferce [conference] I have had previlige of attenedd [attending] was at the Laying of the corner Stone of this house.124 & I have had no health,— and been connected with circumstances [p. [52]] the most forbidding. which doubtless has producd some feeling—— I have never had a doubt of the work . . . my feelings concerning Bennet [John C. Bennett] were always the same, & told my family to guard that fellow. for some time he will make a rupture among this people.— had so little confidence. I always felt myself at his difiance.— I was once theatend [threatened] by warren Parish, <​if I would not coincide with his words.​> I have just such a threatnig [threatening] letter from. J. C. Bennet. that if I did not turn my course. I should feel the force of his power.— there is an increase <​of my​> of hea[l]th & strength. & I desire to serve you in any way it is possible for me to do. If any one has any feelings I hope they will express them.— [p. [53]]
Dymick Huntingtn [Dimick B. Huntington] asked concrning Rigdons. stating that Bennet was a gentleman & had nothing again[s]t him. <​Some time since.​> Rigdon recollects nothing or little about the conversations.— thinks Dimick Mistaken Dimicks knows he was not.—
Rigdon. <​said,​> Bennet never offerd any abuse to my family.— <​& at​> at that time he I had never been familiar with him.— Dymick[:] I have no private pique agai[n]st Elder Rigdon.—
voted, (in general) <​almost unanimous​> that Elder Rigdon retaind his standing.—
<​Joseph presentd Wm Law for trial.​> Moved by. B. Young. 2d By Heber Kimball that Wm Law. & voted that Wm Law— retain his standing.—
Voted unanimously that Hyrum. Smith retain his offices125 as Patriarch. &c.—126 [p. [54]]
Hyrum said the Lord bless the people.
& Elder Rigdon said so too.—
<​Joseph said I do not know any thing agai[n]st the twelve, if I did I would presnt them for trial.​>
It is not right that all the burden of the Nauvoo House should rest on a few individuals—
and <​we​> will now consider the prepriety of sending the twelve to127 collect means for the Nauvoo House.—
there has been too great latitude in individuals for the building of the Temple to the exclusion of the Nauvoo house.
It. has been reportd that the—— twelve have wages $2.00 per day for their services <​I never heard— this till recently. & I do not believe I have never known their having any thing​> I go in for binding up the twelve,128 &
Let this confirence institute an order to this end [p. [55]] <​&​> let no man pay money or stock into the hands of the twelves except the payee payer transmit the account immediately to the Trustee’s in trust. & no man else. <​but the twelve​> have authority to act as agents for the Temple & Nauvoo House.——129
I will mention one case— he is a good man. that’s man’s name is Russel [Samuel M. Russell]. he had been East on bussines[s] for his brothe[r].130 & took money belonging to the temple. & put it in the bag with his brothers money. 2 or three days after <​his return​> he called on his brother, for the money. but his brother thought he had paid out too much money— & he would keep the [p. [56]] chu[r]ch money.— <​to make good his own​> I called to see Russel [Daniel Russell] about the money. and he treated me so politely I concluded he never meant to pay—131 Bro Russel [Samuel Russell]. said, <​that​> his brother said he should not be out of money again.— There was $20. of the chu[r]ch money, & some dried apple for the Prest.132
I propose that your you send moneys for the temple by the twelve some or all; or some agent of your choosing & if you send by others & the money is lost, tis lost to yourselves. I cannot be responsible for it.
It is wrong for the church to make a bridge of my nose133 in appropriati[n]g chu[r]ch funds.—— The incorporation requ[ire]d of me securietis [securities].— which were lodged in the proper hands—134 [p. [57]]
Temple committee have are bound to me in <​the sum​> $2,000— & the chu[r]ch is running to them <​with funds​> every day— & I am not responsible for it.
so long as you consider me worthy to hold this office. it is your duty to attend to the legal forms belonging— to the business.— My desire is, <​that​> the conference minutes go forth, to inform all bra[n]ches of the order of doing business. & the twelve be appointd to this spicial mission of collecting funds for the Nauvoo House.—135
when I went to the white House at Washigtn [Washington]. <​&​> presented Letters from Thomas Carlin. [Martin] Van Buren. said <​Thos Carlin. Thos Carlin​> whos Thos Carlin?— I erred in spirit,— & <​I​> confess my mistake, in being angry with Martin Van Buren [p. [58]] for saying Thos Carlin is nobody.— let it be recorded on earth and in heaven that I am clear of this sin.—136
There has been complaints again[s]t the Temple Committee.— for appropriati[n]g the chu[r]ch funds to the benefit of their own children. to the neglect of others who need assistanc[e] more than they do.—
I have <​the​> complaint, by Wm Clayton. Wm. Clayton called. Says I have to say to the confernce. I am not so fully prepreded [prepared] to present substantiate the proof as I could wish—
I am able to prove that partiality used to a great extent. [p. [59]] I am able to prove by the books that [Reynolds] Cahoon & Higby [Elias Higbee] have used property for their own families— to the exclusion of others.—— <​Joseph said​> Let the. trial of the Committee be deferrd to another day— <​then let​> the Lion & unicorn— come together— day after tomorrow. Mr Clayton can have the privelige of bringing his books. to the trial.—137
Voted that the Moved and Seconded & voted that the twelve be appointed a committe[e] to receive & gather funds to build the Nauvoo House. [blank] with this proviso, that the twelve and give bonds to for good delivery. to trustee in trustee.— & payee payer make immediate report to the trustee in trust.—138 Bro W[illiam] W. Phelps proposd that the twelve give duplicate receipt’s. [p. [60]]
President Young. remarked he should never give reciepts for cash. <​except such as he put in his own pocket for his own use.​> but wished this speculation to stop.— & asked when if any one knew any thing against any one of the twelve, any dishonesty. I know of one who is not.—
Joseph <​And referred to muzzling the ox that treadetheth out the corn.—​>139
Joseph Said, I will answer Bro Brigham,— let the twelve spend the time belonging to the temple for to collect funds— and the remainder of the time they may labor for their support.—140
The idea of not muzzling the ox that treadeth out the corn— is a good old quaker song.—141 I have never taken the first farthing of church funds for my [p. [61]] own use. till I have first consulted the proper author[i]ties.— & when there was no quorum of the twelve or high priests I have asked the temple Committee who had not no business with it.— Elder [Alpheus] Cutler said it was so.— Let this conference stop all agents in collecting funds, except the twelve.——142
1½— P.M. hym by Quoir.— 12— 2 P.M dismissed by prayer O. Hyde— for 1. <​hour​>
1433½ Hyrum commenced by observing that he had some communication. to make before Joseph came, & would read from the wasp. last number.—144 a man who formerly belonged to the Church. reveald to me there are a band of men & some [p. [62]] strong in the faith of the Doctrine of Latter Day Saints. & some who do not belong to the chu[r]ch, <​were bound to by secret oaths &c​> that it is right to steal from any one who does not belong to the church if they gave ¼ part to the temple. if they did not remain stedfast— they ripped open th[e]ir bowels & gave them to the cat fish.— & they are the very gadianton robbers145 of the last days.— then <​read​> his own affidavit. as reprinted in the “Wasp,” dated 26. Nov 1841 <​& the​> doings of the conference at Ramus. & proclamation <​or declarati[o]n of​> of the twelve <​&​> affidavit of Joseph.—146 These This <​t​> said the theif or <​theives​> <​have been compared to​> confessor refers to the little foxes— the presidency &c are the great foxes— & they told. <​us <​me​> this was the interpretation given. the preaching from the <​stand.—​> by the theives​>
David Holman. James Dunn. confessed [p. [63]] <​to me when they lived in my house that​> they had stolen from the world, I told him to get out of my house. the Dunn <​David Holman​> lifted his hand to heaven & swore if I would forgive him he would never do so again. he went to Montrose. & stole & run away to Nauvoo, f[o]und a barrel of flour on the bank. just deliverd from a steam boat. stole the flour went to Keokuk & sold it. saying he had pickd up the barrel in the <​river​> & as it was likely a little damaged he would take $2.00. got his pay & went his way.
made made many observations. to the Saints. on stealing.—
Joseph followed. I want the Elders to make hono[ra]ble proclamati[o]n abroad [p. [64]] what the feelings of the presidency are,— I despise a theif above ground. He would betray me <​if he could get the oppetinity [opportunity]​> if I were the biggest rogue in the world, he would steal my horse when I wanted to run away. <​then​> read prloclamatin [proclamation] of the Mayor on stealing. dated 25. day March 1843.— “Wasp.” No. 48[th]—147 many observati[o]n confirmatory & said, enough Said. for this conference on this Subject.—
Elders had have a privilige to appeal from any decision of a branch. to know if they shall retain their office or membership—
necessary I explain concerni[n]g Keokuk it is known that the Govr of Iowa has granted a writ. for me. on affidav[i]t [p. [65]] of [Lilburn W.] Boggs.— he still holds that writ as a cudgel over my head. (U. S. Atttorney told me all writs issued thus were legally dead.)—148 I said that is a stumper & I will shew them a trick the Devil never did. <​that is​> leave them. every man who wishes to out economically. with regard to futurity.— let them come over here149 as soon as they can settle their affairs without sacrifice let them come & we will protect them & let that governme[n]t know that we don’t like to be imposed upon.—
about the first of August 1842 Mr [Jacob] Remick came to my house. put on a long face. said he was in distress. about to loose $1400 for <​a debt of​> 300 at sheriffs [p. [66]] sale. <​said he the​> sale takes place to-morrow.— I have money in St Louis . . .— next morning he called. I did not like the looks of him. <​but thought I​> he is a stranger. I have been a stranger, &. better loose 200 than be guilty of sin of ingratitude. took his note. on demand. <​the​> day I was taken I asked him from [for?] the money.— you ought to have it <​said he but​> I have not got my mony from St Louis.— I have a curious plan in my mind. I will give you a quit claim deed of the land you bought of [Isaac] Galland & <​your notes to​> Gallands notes which I have as his agent” I, said Joseph, have not asked you for your property. & would not give a snap. <​for it.​>— but I will accept your offer. but want my money— <​Said he I will give you deed.​> ½ my land in the) [p. [67]] state.) <​&​> he gave me deeds. & I got them recorded.—150 he calld for some more favors. & I let him have some cloths— <​to the amount of​> 6 or 7 hundrd dollars. I have offerd this land to many, who if they would go to settle there but nobody will go.—151 <​I agre[e]d​> if I found he owned as much as he pretended I would give my influence to build up Keokuk. J. G. Remick. <​is his name he has got almost​> most $1100 <​from me,​> he looks exactly like a woodchuck, & talks like a woodchuck on a stump with a chaw of tobacco. <​in his mouth.​> he tried to git his hands to steal a stove from near my stove152 & carry it off on the boat raft,153 he is a thief.— My advice is, [p. [68]] if they choose, <​to​> come away from Keokuk. and not go there more. I am not so much of a christian as many suppose I am. when a man undertakes to ride me. I am apt to thud154 <​kick​> him off & ride him.—
I would’nt b[u]y property in the Iowa. I considerd it stooping to accept it a <​as a​> gift.—
<​I wish to speak of the​>—— ½ breed lands opposite this. city. ½ breed land.— ½ breed land.— and every man there who is not ½ breed had better come away.155 & in a little time we will call them all ½ breed.— I wish we could swap some of our ½ breeds here for <​the ½ breeds who​> lives there. I will give you a key, if any <​one​> will growls tomorrow you will know him to be a ½ breed.— [p. [69]] My opinion is the Legislature have done well in giving the best tittle to settlers. & squatter.— Those who have deeds to those islands156 from the chancery of Iowa. have as good titles as any, but the settlers under <​the​> Laws of Iowa. Legislature & chancery of Iowa. <​are​> at variance.
I believe it a fine157 of swindli[n]g from by. court of Chancery.—
Dr Galland said those Islands dont belong to any body, <​they were​> throon [thrown] out of U.S. survey.— hence no man had a claim, <​& it was​> so considerd; when I came here.—
my advice to the Mormons, who have deed & possessions, <​is​> fight it out. you who have no deeds or possessi[o]ns, let them [p. [70]] alone.— touch not a stick of their timber.—
Deeds given by court of chancery. warrents & defends again[s]t all unlawful claims.— It is a ½ breed, it an anomaly, without form & void, a nondescript. if they have your note. let them come here & sue you then you can carry up your case to the highest court.— so long as the Laws have a shadow of tittle, it is not right for the Mormons to go & carry away the wood In the name of the Lord God, I forbid any man from using any observati[o]ns of mine, to rob— the land of wood.——
Moses Martin has had been tried & had fellowship withdrawn <​by the chu[r]ch​> at Keokuk. Nashville [Iowa Territory] [p. [71]]
<​The question has been asked​>
can a member not belonging to the chu[r]ch158 bring a member before the high council, for trial? I answer No! I ask no jurisdiction. <​in religious matters​> I merely give my opinion when asked. If there was any feelings at Naashville because I gave my opniones [opinions], there is no occasion for it. I only advice the breth[r]en to come from Iowa, & they may do as they please. <​about coming.​> If I had not actually got into this work, & been called of God, I would back out . . . but I cannot back out,— I have no doubt of the truth. were I going to prophecy. I would procpesy [prophesy] the end will not come in 1844. or 5— or 6. or 40 years more [p. [72]] there are those of the rising generation who shall not taste death till christ come.
<​I was once praying earnestly upon this subject. and a voice said unto me.​> My son, if thou livest till thou art 85 years of age, thou shalt see the face of the son of man. . . . <​I was left to draw my own conclusions concerni[n]g this &,​> I took the liberty to conclude that if I did live till that time Jesus <​he​> would make his appearance.— <​but I do not say whether he will make his appeara[n]ce, or I shall go where he is.—​>159
I prophecy in the name of the Lord God.— & let it be written. <​that the​> Son of Man will not come in the heavns till I am 85. years old

Paul says ye are th[e] children of the light & not of the darkness, that that day [p.

Templee committee were called up for trial.171 at 11. o’clock. <​Wm Clayton said.​> some may expect I am going to be a means of a downfall. of the Temple committee. tis not so. but I design to shew they have been partial.172
Elder Higby [Elias Higbee] has over run the amount allowed by trustees about ¼.— pretty much all elder Higby’s son has receivd in money & store pay.— Higbys son has had nothing deducted [p. [78]] for his tenth.
Elder [Reynolds] Cahoon.
Wm. S. Cahoon [William F. Cahoon] has paid all his tenth
the others of Cahoons sons have had nothing to their credit in tenth.
the committee have had a great amou[n]t of store pay.—
one man who is laboring continually wanted 25 cts. in store when his family were sick.— Higby said he could not have it.
Wm S. Cahoon173 was never appointed a boss— over the cutting shop.— but was requsted to keep an amou[n]t of labor in the shop.— during the last 6 months very little has been brought into to the committee. [p. [79]]
there are certain individuals in this city who are watching every man who has any thing to give the temple.— to get it from him— & pay for the same in his labor.—
Elder [Alpheus] Cutler— said he did not know of any wrong. if any one would shew it he would make it right.— voted. Clear, unanimisly
Elder [Reynolds] Cahoon. said this is not an unexpectd matter at all. to be called up. I do not want you to think I am perfect

The Marshall brought up a man for disorderly. conduct. Mayor fined him $5,00 or go out of the crouwd.— The
<​[Reynolds] Cahoon said:—​>
The better people have been known my proceedings. the better they have liked them.—
when. President Smith had goods last summer we had better property. goods would not bye corn without some cash.— instead of horses &c, we took store pay.— I have dealt out meal & flour to the hands to the last ounce when I had not a morsel of bread meal or flour in my house; if the Trustee.175 Bro Hyrum [Smith]. or the twelve or <​all​> any will examine & see if I have too much it shall go freely.— [p. [81]] I call upon all the brethren if they have any thing. to bring it forward & have it adjusted.
Hyrum. Said he felt it his duty to defend the committe[e] so far as he could. he wo[u]ld as soon go to hell as be a committee. . . . but to make a comparison for the temple committee. a little boy came in & said he saw an elephant on a tree. & the people did not beleive it. & they looked and it was only an owl.—
[Reynolds] Cahoon said when Bro Cutler was gone. Higbee keept the books, & we have found as many mistakes again[s]t Bro Higby, as & in his favor . . . . voted unanimously clear in his favor—— [p. [82]]
Elder Higby— said he <​I​> was am not afraid or ashamed to appear before you.—

President Joseph. statd that the business of the confernce had closed. & the rem[ai]nder of the confernce would be devoted to instruction176—— it is an insult to the meeting to have people run out of meeting <​Just​> before we close. if they must go let them go ½ an hour before.

The 2d advent of the Son of God is a subject which occupies the attention of the people. of this day. the Latter day Saints belive he will come at least 1000 years before the final consummation.— Millerit[e]s belive he will make his 2d advent in a few months,177 but they will find themselves mistaken. . . .
mistaken as they are good will coome out of the investigation. it will arouse the attention of multitudes to an the178 faccts179 as they exist or will open the minds of the people to the truth when it shall be proclaimed by the elders of Israel. . . . They belive that the stone is not to strike the image on [p. [85]] his feet180 till181 the 2d advent. & a kingdom will come direct from heaven.—182 we belive god will not destroy the kingdoms of the earth till. he has set <​up​> his own kingdom.
Do Millerites look for more revalation? No! they raise the midnight cry183 but does not tell the people what to do. Latter D[ay] S[aints] <​are the​> most reasonable.— & the most inteleget [intelligent] of any people on the face of the whole earth.— I have tried <​them​> 13 years.— <​I had as​> lives worship a horrs [horse] or a stump as a God who gives no instruction to his people.
Ancient of Days.— one came to the Ancient of Days—184 Many suppose this was the son. after jud[g]ment. sat son of man comes to Ancient of Days. [p. [86]] the most Ancient man of God that lived in days. else he could not have been the Ancient of Days. Father Adam is to come, and organize a great Council to prepare for the coming of the 2d advent—185 Jesus comes to the Ancient of Days186

one man thinks he is authorizd to call on men to repent. &c— I defy any one to scan187 the errors of any genraations. without revelations.
Resurrection. . . . <​of the body is denyed​> by many because it is contrary to the law<​s​> of nature. because. flesh & bones are constantly changing— completely oncee188 in 7 or 10 years. . . . if this is [p.

I do not beleive that more than ¾ of our bodies is composed of animal organizati[o]n.189 but is purely vegetable, hence through all the 70 years a man will have one or two parts. which will be the same original.— if he receives the matter if of the is <​was​> in possession of 50 years before he died— he is has the same bady [body].—

said he had no doubt but that many who were baptizd by John enjoyd much of the religion of Jesus.— but when he came. there was more light.— and unless they followd it. the light that they had received became darkness. If the sects have any power it is only such as they have usurped from the Pope [p.

8 April 1843 • Saturday
199Prayer by Elder [John] Taylor—
3 requ[e]sts.200
1st that all who have faith will pray Lord to calm the wind. for as it is now. I can not speak.
2 that the Lord will strength<​en​> my Lungs—
3d that I may have the Holy Ghost.
The subject whicch I shall sp[e]ak from <​is​> the, beasts spoken of by John.—201 I have seldom spoken from <​the revelati[o]ns​> & I do it now to do away division & not that the knowledge is so much needed.—
knowledge is necessary to prevent division although it may puff up it does away suspince [suspense]——
in knowledge is power, hence [p. [95]] God202 knows how to subject all beings he has power— over all.
should not have called up this subject if it had not been for this old white head before. Father [Pelatiah] Brown.—— I did not like the old man being called up. <​before the High council.​>— for erring in doctrine.—— why I feel so good to have the privelige of thinki[n]g & believing as I please.
they undertook to correct him there Whether they did or not I dont care203
Rev— 5 chap. 8 verse.—
Father Brown had been to work & confounded all christendom, that these were figure John saw in heavn to represent the different kingdoms of God on earth. [p. [96]] he put down sectarianism, & so far so good.—— but I could not help laughing that God should take a figure of a beast to repr[e]sent his kingdom consisting of <​Men​>. . . . To take a lesser figure to represnt a gr[e]ater, old white head you missed it that time. By figure of Beasts God represented the kingdoms of the world.— Bear. Lion &c represe[n]ted the kingdoms. of the world, Says Daniel.204 <​for​>
I refer to the prophets, to qualify my observations. to keep out of the wasp nests or young elders,
The things John205 say saw had no allusion to the day of Adam Enoch Abraham or Jesus— only as clearly specified & set forth to John. I saw that that which [p. [97]] was lying in futurity. Rev 1.1.— read <​is​> key to the whole subject
4. beasts. & 24 Elders which was out of every nation— <​it is​> great stuffing, to stuff all nations into 4 beasts & 24 Elders things which <​he​>206 saw had no allusions to what had been.— but what must shortly come to pass.— Rev is one of the plain[e]st. books god ever caused to be written—
what John saw he saw in heaven— <​that which the​> the prophet Saw, in vision, <​was​> on earth, <​and​> in Hebrew, <​it​> is a Latitude & Longitude compar[e]d with English version
they saw figurs of beasts.— they why, Dani[e]l did not say <​see​> a207 lion & a bear. he saw an image like unto a bear:— in every [p. [98]] place.— John saw. the actual beast itself. <​it was​> to let John know that beasts existed there & not to represent figurs of things on the208 Earth.—— <​The​> prophets always had interpretati[o]ns of the[i]r209 visions &c
God always holds himself respons[i]ble to give revelati[o]ns of his visions & <​if​> he does it not. we are not responsible.—
speculators need not fear they shall be condemnd. if God has given no Rev[elation]
How do you prove John saw visions Beasts in heaven? 5 <​C[hapter]​> 11 <​v—​> Revelation.— 13 verse every creature. which was in heaven and on the Earth
I John saw all beasts &c in heaven. for I expect he saw the beasts of <​a​> 1000 forms <​from​> 10,000 worlds like this.— the grand secret was to tell what [p. [99]] was210 in heaven.— God will gratify himself with all these animals. . . .
says one I cannot beleive in salvati[o]n of bea[s]ts.— I suppose God could underst[a]nd the beasts &c, in certain worlds— the 4 beasts, were angels there. dont know where they came from; <​they were inteligent​> inteligent.—
<​but my​> Darling religion, says, <​they​> meant something beside beast.— then the 24 elders must mean something else:— 4 beasts meant211 Buonpart [Bonaparte] & Cyrus. &c— then the 24 elders ment212 the kingdoms of the Beasts.— It is all as flat as a pancake
what do <​you​> use such flat & vulger <​expressions. for​> being a prophet? because the old women understa[n]d it, they make [p. [100]] pancakes.— the whole argument is flat, & I dont know of any thing bette[r] to repr[e]sent.— the argument.—
there is no revelation any where to shew that the beasts meant any thing but beasts
O ye Elders of Israel hearken to my voice & when ye are sent into the world to preach. tell those things you are sent to tell. declare the first principles, & let mysteries alone lest you be overthrown.—
Father Brown when you go to palmyrar [Palmyra]213 say nothi[n]g about the 4 B[e]asts Danl. 12 13 . . . <​C.​> 2. verse—214 <​some say​> Deadly wound.— <​means​> Nebuchadnezzar.— Constantine.— & the catholic [p. [101]] now for the wasp nest.— priests. & Dragon for Devil they have translated beast in heaven— it was not to rep[res]ent beast on heaven— it was an angel in heaven. who has power in the last days to do a work.—— all the world wonderd after the beast:— <​&​> if the beast was all the world. how could the world wonderd after the beast? When the old devil shall give power to to the beast to do all his mighty work all the wo[r]ld will wonder—
who is able to make war with the beast?215 says the inhabita[n]ts of the earth.— if it means216 the kin[g]doms of the world it dont mean the kingdoms [p. [102]] of the Saints.— who is able to make war with my gr[e]at big self.— The Dragon.— we may interpret it.— & it is sometimes Apolyel.—217 9 verse 12 chap—218 key word.— independent beasts. abstract from the human family.— (25 minutes past 11. lungs faild— the wind blew briskly.)— I said more than I <​ever​> did before except once at Ramus. & then the little <​upstarts <​fellows​> stufferd219 me like a cock​>. cock turkey— <​with the prop[h]ecies of Daniels—​> and crammed it down my throat. with their fingerss—220
after singing[,] 27— to 12 John Taylor commenced. saying I did not know but I might say someth[i]ng but since the prophet has got [p. [103]] through I find there is nothing left but the tail.— Elder Taylor says— if you write it down we are all fools it will not be <​very​> far from the mark”—— No man in the church knows any thing but what He has been told.—
he had never said much about Bea[s]ts &c in his preaching & when he had, he had done it to attract attention & keep the people from running after a greater fool than himself.
Daniel saw an image of Gold &c Iron. Clay &c.— the prop[h]et explained. thou Nebuchadnezzar— art the kindom head— &c221

Prayr by Elder Cahoon.— Singing.—
<​12 <​mi[nutes]​>— 3—​> Elder Taylor— resumed th[e] subject where he adjour[ne]d in the forenoon Little horn222 was the Pope some say— Pope of Rome prevaild against the saints or chu[r]ch—— whence the Chu[r]ch of England [p.

mentiond the 10 kingdoms or the toes.
while in the days of these kings or some of them. the God of heaven should set up a kingdom which which should never end.223 I am not going to say
with regard to the littl stone, when when this kingdom will be set up. but it will be a kingdom. & the saints will take & possess it. & it will be a kingdom on earth not in heaven.— not Methodist. not Presbyt[er]ian or babtist I was going to say the church of Rome comes the [p. [106]] nearest. to a kingdom. of any of them. Not. Millerites. they expect. thee 224coming of christ is like lightning.225 whereas the kingdom is like a little stone cut out of the mountain without hands—226 3:20— Singing Choir.—
Elder O. Hyde said it was 3 years since I met with you & was set apart to a foreign mission by you.—227
Mat. 24 chapter. in part read. conce[r]ning the temple—228 Jesus acted very unchristian like. & uncharitable. and meddld with other peoples property. took a scourge of small cords & drove them out of the temple.229 the german bible says there shall not be one stone left upon another that shall not be broken.—230 [p. [107]]
Compard the Gifts in the church to the gifts <​golden​> in the chu[r]ches vessels of the temple which Nebuchadnazzar or some other nezzar took away.— where are they? in. Babylon.231 wrapped up in a napkin.— give me so much money & I will give you so much Gospel— say the Sectarian priests.
There is now and then one,
Like the gleaning of grapes when vintage is done232
he233 compard the Mormons to the rough stone. which could not be made to fit any where & would be thrown away— so with the Mormons the[y] will not for fit any way or where, but Must [p. [108]] be cast out. by all soci[e]ties, & yet at last they will come out head of the heap— the saints shall possess the kingdom234
I have been in the four quarters of the world among 14 or 15 diff[er]ent languages & people— & they all agree that some great event is coming. close at hand is coming. what has produced this impression? the true light that light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world.—235 it is like the press that presses the paper on to the whole type at once. & God is the press-man.
when this gospel has been prea[c]hed to all nations. the hour of his judgmnt is come.—236

I most heartily congratulate you on your safe arrival— at Nauvoo. & your safe deliverance from all the dangers & diffcultis you have had to encou[n]ter
but you must not think your tribulations. are ended.—
I shall not address you on doctrin but concerni[n]g your temporal welfare
inasmuch as you have come up here assaying to keep the Comma[n]dments <​of God​> I pronou[n]ce the blessings of heaven <​& earth​> upon you. & inasmuch as will <​follow​> counsel. & act wisely. & do right [p. [121]] these blessings shall rest upon you so far as I have power of <​with​> God to seal them up[o]n you
I am you[r] servnt. & it is only through the Holy Ghost. that I can do you good. God is able to do his own work.
we do not present ourselves <​before you​> as any thing but your humble servnts. willing to be spent spend & be spent in your servant services.
we shall dwell on your temperal welware [welfare]. on this occasion. In the 1st place. where a crowd is flocking from all parts of the world of diffrt [different] minds; religion; &c, <​there will be some​> who do not live up to the Commandm[en]ts. <​there will be​>— & designing characters, [p. [122]] who would turn you aside & lead you astray.— specluators who would get away your property. therefore it is necessary we should have an order here, <​&​> when emigra[n]ts arrive to instruct. them concerning these things.
If the heads of the church had have laid the foundati[o]ns <​of this place, & have had the trouble of​> & of doing what has been done— are they not better qualifid to tell you how to lay out your money & than those who have had no interest— &c
Some start on the revelati[o]ns254 to come here. & get turned away & loose all, & then come, and enter their complaints, <​to us​> when it is too late to do any thing for them [p. [123]]
the object of this meeting is to tell you these things & then if you <​will pursue the same cou[r]ses you must bear the consequence. There are sev[er]al objects in your coming here——​> one objct has been to bring you from. Sectarian bondage another. from National bondage. where you can be planted in a fertile soil, We have brought you into a free government. not that you are to consider yourselves outlaws. by free governme[n]t, we do not mean that a man has a right to steal <​rob​>. &c <​but free​> from Bondage. taxation— oppression. free in every thing if he conduct himself hone[s]tly & circumspe[c]tly with his n[e]ighbor, free in a spiritual capacity.— [p.

This is the place that is appointed for the oracles of God to be revealed. If you have any darkness you have only to ask & the dar[k]ness is removed. tis not necessary that miracles should be <​wrought​> to remove darkness Miracles are the fruits of faith. “how shall we believe on him on <​of​> whom <​&c​>255 &c we have not heard.
I.E. inasmuch as I have received knowledge before I God may correct <​the scriptur by me if he choose​>
faith comes by hearing the word of God.256 <​& not faith by hearing & hearing by the word &c​> If a man has not faith enough to do one thing he may do another, <​if he cannot remove a Mountain he may heal the Sick.​> where faith is there will be some of the fruits. all gift & powed <​which were​> out <​poured​> out from heaven were poured out on [p.

If they these <​the​> speculators run again[s]t me they run again[s]t the buckler of Jehovah.— God did not send me up as he did Joshua, in former days God sent [p. [129]] his servnts to fight, but in the last days he has promised to fight the battle himself.265

16 April 1843 • Sunday
Sunday morning April 16. 1843 Meeting at the Temple. A.M. 10. o ck
Joseph read Bro [Parley P.] Pratts letters to the Editor277 of “T[imes] & Seasons” concrning the death of Lorenzo Barn[e]s.278 <​& remarked he read it because it was so appropriate to all who had died in the faith.—​> Almost all who have fallen in these last days, in the church, have fallen in a strange land, this is a strange land. to tho[s]e who have come from a distance.
we should cultivate sympathy for the afflicted. among us.
If there is a place on earth. where men should cultivate this spirit & pour in the oil & wine <​in the bosom of the afflicted​> it is this place.
<​and this spirit is manifest here—​> and although he is a stranger <​& afflicted.​> when he arrives, he finds. a brother— & friend ready to administer to his necessities.— [p. [139]]
another remark, I would esteem it one of the greatest blessings, if I am to be afflicted in this world, to have my lot cast where I can find breth[r]en279 & friends all arou[n]d me, <​but​> this is not. <​thing. I referred to is <​it​> is​> to have the privilige of having our dead buri[e]d on the land where god has appointd to gather his saints together,— & where there will be nothing but saints, where they may have the privelige of laying their bodies where <​the​> Son will make his appearance. & where they may hear the. sound of the trump that shall call them forth, to behold him, that in the morn of the resurrecti[o]n, they may come forth in a body. & come right up out of their graves. & strike hands <​immediately​> in eternal glory. <​& felicity rather​> than to be [p. [140]] scattered thousands of miles apart. There is something good. & sacred to me— <​in this thing.​> the place where a man is buried has been sacred to me.— <​this subjct is made mention of—​> In Book of Mormon & Scripturs. & <​to​> the aborigines <​regard​> the burying places of the<​ir​> fathers as <​is​> more sacred that than any thing else.
When I. heard of the death of our beloved bro <​Barns it would not have affected me so much​> if I had the opp[o]rtunity of burying him in the land of Zion. I beleive, those who have buried their friends here their condition is enviable. Look at Joseph in Egypt how he required his friends to bury him in the tomb of his fathers,— see the expence & great company— & <​which attended the​> embalming. <​&c <​and​> the going up of the great company. to his burial.​>280
It has always been considird a g[r]eat curse not to obtain an honorable buryal. <​& one of the gratest curses the anci[e]nt prophets could put on any one was. that he man should go without a burial.​>281 [p. [141]]
I have said, father, I desire to be burid here, & before I go home, but if <​this is not thy will​> not may I return, or find Some kind friend to bring me back, & gather my friends, who have fallen in foreign lands, & bring them up hither, that we may may all lie282 together.—
I will tell you what I283 want. if tomorrow I shall be calld to lay in yonder tombs. in the morning of the resurrecti[o]n, let me strike hand<​s​> with my father, & cry, my father, & he will say my son, my Son,— as soon as the rock rends. & before we come out of our graves.284
& may we contemplate these things so? [p. [142]] yes, if we learn how to live & how to die [blank]. when we lie down we contemplat how we may rise up in the morni[n]g and <​it is​> pleasing for friends to lie down together locked in the arms of love, to sleep, & wake in each others embrace <​& renew their conversation.​>
would you think it strange that I relate what I have seen in vision in relation.— this intere[s]ting theme.
Those who have died in Jesus christ, may expect to enter in to all that fruition of Joy when they come forth. which they have possessed here, [p. [143]]
so plain was the vision I actually saw men, before they had ascend[e]d from the tomb, as though they were getti[n]g up slowly, they tooke285 each othe[r] by the hand & it was my father & my Son. my mother & my daughter. <​my brother & my sister​> & when the voice calls, suppose I am laid by the side of my fathe[r].— what would be the first Joy of my heart? where is my fathr. my mother. my sister. they are by my side <​I embrace them. & they me.​>
It is my meditati[o]n all the day & more than my meat & drink to know how I shall make the saints of God to comprehe[n]d the visions286 that roll like <​an​> overflowing surge; to <​before​> my vision <​mind​>. [p. [144]]
O how I wo[u]ld delight to bring before you things which you never thought of. but poverty. & the cares of the world prevent. but I am glad I have the privilige of communicati[n]g to you some things, which if grasped closely a will be a help to you when the clouds <​are​> gath[eri]ng. & the storms <​are​> ready—— to bu[r]st up[o]n you like peals of thunder, lay hold of these things & let not you[r] knees tremble, <​nor your hearts faint.​> what can Earthequakes do. wars. & tornados do? nothing.— all your losses will be made up to you in the resurrecti[o]n provi[d]ed you continue faithful
by the vision of the almighty I have seen it.— [p. [145]] more painful to me the thoughts of annihilation & than death. if I had no expectation of seeing my mother Broth[ers] &c Sisters & fri[e]nds again my heart would burst in a moment. & I should go down to my grave. The expectati[o]n of seeing my f[r]iends in the morni[n]g of the resurrection cheers my soul. and make be bear up aginst the evils of life. it it is like their taking a long journey. & on their return we meet them with increasd joy.
God has reveald his son from the heavens. & the doctrine of the resurrection also. & we have a knowledge that those we bury here. God bring them up again. clothed upon, &287 quckend [quickened] by the spirit [p. [146]] of the great god. & what mattereth it whether we lay them down, or we lay down with them. when we can live keep them no longer
then let them sink down; like a ship in the storm. the mighty anchor holds the storm so let those288 thuths [truths] sink down in our hearts. that we may even here begin to enjoy.289 that which shall be in full hereafter.
Hosanna. Hosanna. Hosanna, to Almighty god that rays of light begin to bu[r]st fo[r]th upon us even now.
I cannot find words to express myself I am not learnd. but I have as good feelings as any man. O that I had the [p. [147]] the language of the archangel to express my feelings290 once to my frends. but I never expect to
when othe[r]s regoice I regoice. when I they mourn I would mourn—
to Marcellus Bates. let me admi[ni]ster comfort, you shall soon have the company of your291 companion in a wo[r]ld of glory—292 & the frends of Bro. Barns.— & all the saints who are mourning, this has been a warning voice to us all. to be sober— & diligent— & lay aside mirth & vanity. & folly.—— & be prepard to die tomorrow . . .

after adjournmnt. while conver[s]ing with Dr Brink & Esqr Marr. Joseph said he had been called to thousands of cases in sickness & he had never faild of administerd administ[er]ing comfort, where the patient had thrown themself unreservedly on him and the reason was he never prescribed any that would injure the patient if it did him no good.— I have lost a fathe[r] brothe[r] [p. [156]] & child because. in my anxiety I have depended more on the jud[g]ment of other men than my own, while I have raised up others who were lower than they were.
I will here remark (& by the326 bye I will say that man who stands there (pointing to Levi Richa[r]ds) is the best physic[i]an I have ever been acquainted with. & I say it hone[s]tly.)327 people will seldom die with disease provided we know it seasonably. & treat it mildly. pat[i]ently. & perseveri[n]gly. & do not use harsh means. It is like the Irishmans digging down the mountain. he does not put his shoulder to it to push it over but puts it in his wheell barrow & carries it away day after day. & day after day. [p. [157]] and perseveres & the whole mountain is removed, so we should persevere in the use of simple remedies. (& not push again[s]t the constitution of the pati[e]nt.) day after day & the disease will be removed & the pati[e]nt saved. It is better to save the life of a man than to raise one from the dead. 1 P.M. to Dinner

Joseph said. to the Twelve.—329
Go in the name of the Lord God & tell [p. [158]] [Lucien] Woodworth to put the hands onto the Nauvoo House & begin the work. & be patient till means can be provided.—330
call on the inhabitants of Nauvoo. & get them to bring in their means, then Go to Laharpe & serve them the same.
Thus commence your career,
And never stand still till the Master appear, for it is necessary the house should be done.
Out of the stock that is handed me. you shall have as you have need. for the laborer is worthy of his hire.331
I hereby command the hands to go to work on the house trusting in the Lord. Tell Woodworth to put them on & he shall be backed up with it.— You must get cash, [p. [159]] property, lands, horses, cattle &c, & flour, corn wheat &c. the grain can be grou[n]d at this mill. If you can get hands onto the house it will give such an impetus to the work, it will never stop till it is completed. Let the twelve keep together. you will do more good to keep together, not travel together. but. meet in conference alternately from place to— place & associate together, & not be fou[n]d more than 200 miles apart— Thus travel from Maine here till they make a perfect highway from for the Saints, from here to maine.
It is better for you to be togethe[r]. for it is difficult for a man to have strength of Lungs & health to be instant in season & out of season.— under all circumstances & you can [p. [160]] assist each other, & when you go & spend. a day or two in a place you will find it as it is with [William] miller.332 they will gather together in great companies.
If 12 men cannot build that house they are poor tools.
President Young asked if the Twelve should go to England? Said Joseph.—
No. I dont want the Twelve to go to England this year. I have sent them to England & they have broke the ice <​& done well​> & now I want to send some of the Elders & try them. I will not I designate who.333 Lorenzo Snow may stay at home till he gets rested.334
The twelve must travel to Save their lives. I feel all the veins & Stratas necessary for [p. [161]] the twelve to move in to save their lives
You can never make any thing out of Benjamin Winchester. if you take him out of the channel he wants to be in.335
Send Samuel James to England.336 thus saith the Lord, also. Reuben Hedlock. he’s a heavenly messenger whereever he goes.337 [blank] need not be in a hurry. send these two. & when you think of some one else send them.
John Taylor. I believe you can do more good in the editorial department338 than preaching. he can write for thousands to read while he can preach to but few. We have no one else we can trust the paper with. & hardly with you. you suffer the paper to come out with so many mistakes. [p. [162]]
<​Parley may stay at home & build his house.​>339
Bro Geo. A. Smith. I dont know how I can help him to a living. but to go. put on a long face & make them doe [dole?] over to him if he will go his lungs will hold out. the Lord will give him a good pair of lungs yet.—340
Woodruff can be spared from the printing office,341 if you both stay you will die.342
Orson Pratt. I want him to go.
Bro Brigham asked if he should go? Yes, Go. I want John E. Page. to be called away from pittsburgh. send a good elder to take his place.343
Orson Hyde can go. & travel.—
You will all go to Boston.344
I want Elder Richards to continue in the history [p. [163]] at present. perhaps he will have to travel some to save his life. The History is going out by little & little in the papers & cutting its way.345 so that when it is completed it will not raise a persecution again[s]t us.
When Lyman Wight comes home I intend to send him right back again.346
Wm Smith is going east with his sick wife.347
I want you to cast up a highway for the saints from here to maine.
[Heber C.] Kimball will travel.
Dont be scart about the temple. dont say any thing against it. but make all men know your mission is to build the Nauvoo House. [p. [164]]
It is not necessary that Joshua Grant should be ordained a high Priest. he is to[o] young. he is one of Zebedee Coltrins children, & has got into Zebedee’s spirit. & Jedediah [M. Grant] also.348 & they clip ½ their words. & I intend to heal them of it.—349 If a highpriet [high priest] comes along and goes to snub. him. let him knock his teeth down his throat &c. &c—
You shall make a monstrous wake as you go.
[William] Clayton, tell the temple committee to put hands on that house (Diagonal corner f[r]om the Brick Store) to finish it forthwith. right off. the Lord hath need of other houses as well as a temple.350
If I can sell $10,000 of property this spring. I will meet you at any confrence in [p. [165]] Maine, or any confernce where you are and stay as long as it is wisdom.
Take [blank] Zundall [John Jacob Zundel] & [blank] [blank] Messer [Frederick Moeser] & tell them never to drink a drop of ale, or wine <​or any spirit​> only that which flows right out from the presence of God. & send them to Germany.351 & when you meet with an Arab. send him to Arabia, when you find an Italian send him to Italy. & a french man to France. or an Indian that is suitable. send him among the Indians. & this & that man send them. to the diff[er]ent places where they belong.— send sombody to Central America. To Spanish [p. [166]] America & dont let a single corner of the earth go without a mission.
Write to Oliver Cowdery. & ask him if he has not eat husks long enough:352 if he is not [illegible]353 ready to return & go up to Jerusalem, Orson Hyde hath need of him.354 (A letter was written & signed by the me[m]bers of the Quorum present)355

Editorial Note
On 12 May 1843, the Quorum of the Twelve, which had been authorized by a church conference in April 1843 to raise funds for the Nauvoo House, scheduled a trip to Lima, Illinois, for JS, Wilford Woodruff, George A. Smith, and “B Nobles”—possibly Joseph Bates Noble. The four men left for Lima the following day, while Willard Richards, who was keeping JS’s journal, remained in Nauvoo.410 Woodruff noted that on 14 May, JS spoke on knowledge, having one’s calling and election made sure, and the “more sure word of Prophecy,” after which George A. Smith “followed with a few remarks.” At a meeting held later that day, Woodruff and George A. Smith spoke on “obeying the Commandments by building the Nauvoo House.” After the meetings, Woodruff wrote, they “all rode to Lima & took supper,” suggesting that the meetings had been held in nearby Yelrome, a settlement of church members. JS and the others returned to Nauvoo on 15 May 1843.411

JS, William Clayton, and several others—George Miller, Eliza Partridge, Lydia Partridge, Julia M. Smith, and Lorin Walker—left for Carthage and Ramus, Illinois, on 16 May, while Willard Richards, who was keeping JS’s journal at the time, remained in Nauvoo. According to Clayton’s record, the group stayed only fifteen minutes in Carthage before proceeding to Ramus, where JS taught Benjamin F. and Melissa LeBaron Johnson about eternal marriage: “He said that except a man and his wife enter into an everlasting covenant and be married for eternity while in this probation by the power and authority of the Holy priesthood they will cease to increase when they die (i e) they will not have any children in the resurrection, but those who are married by the power & authority of the priesthood in this life & continue without committing the sin against the Holy Ghost will continue to increase & have children in the celestial glory.” On 17 May, after a “pleasure ride” through Fountain Green, Illinois, in the morning, JS preached from the first chapter of 2 Peter about knowledge, salvation, and “the more sure word of prophecy.” Later in the day, following further discussion of eternal marriage, JS attended the Ramus city council meeting, “rode out” with the Johnson family, and attended a lecture given by a Methodist preacher. JS “offered some corrections” about Genesis 2:7 following the lecture and also taught that “spirit” was a “more fine or pure” form of matter than is discernible by natural means. JS and his party returned to Nauvoo on 18 May 1843. Portions of JS’s teachings given on 16 and 17 May were later canonized.417

Have not the least idea but if Christ should come and preach such rough thi[n]gs as he preahd [preached] to the Jews. but this generati[o]n would reject reject him for b[e]ing so rough. I never can find much to say in expou[n]ding a text. [p. [240]]

It was the design in the cou[n]cils of heaven before the world was. that the pri[n]ciple & law of that pri[e]sthood was predicated up[o]n the gathe[rin]g of the people in every age of the world.

where there is no change of pri[e]sthood there is no change of ordina[n]ces says peter Paul,488 If God has not changed the ordinances & pri[e]sthood. howl ye [p. [242]] sectarians. if he has where has he revealed it. have ye turnd revelators? then why deny it.?
men have thought many things insutabl [inscrutable] in the last days. that he should raise the dead.
Things have been hid from before the foundation of the [world] to be reveald in to babes in the last days.—489
there are a great ma[n]y wise men & women to[o] in our midst to[o] wise to be taught. & they mu[s]t die in their ignoranc[e] and in the resurrection they will find their mistake.

It always has been when a man was sent of good [God] with the Prethood [priesthood]. & he began to preach the fulness of the gospel. that was thut [thrust] out by his fri[e]nds.—— and they are ready to but[c]her him if he teach things which th[e]y had imagind to be wrong.— Jesus was crucifi[e]d upon this principle—
I will turn linguist. ma[n]y things in the bible. whi[c]h do not. as th[e]y now stand. accord with the revelati[o]n of th[e] holy Gho[s]t to me.—

Editorial Note
Willard Richards, who was keeping JS’s journal at the time, did not accompany JS and his family to visit Emma Smith’s sister in Lee County, Illinois. On 17 June, four days after JS left Nauvoo, governor of Illinois Thomas Ford issued a writ for JS’s arrest on a requisition Ford had received from Missouri governor Thomas Reynolds charging JS with treason against the state of Missouri.512 Hearing of the writ, William Clayton and Stephen Markham rode horseback almost 190 miles—by Clayton’s reckoning—in sixty-four hours to warn JS of possible arrest. Clayton and Markham met JS on 21 June and delivered the message.513 Two days later, in spite of the warning, JS was arrested by Harmon T. Wilson, deputy sheriff of Hancock County, Illinois, and Joseph H. Reynolds, sheriff of Jackson County, Missouri. With the help of legal counsel, JS eventually managed to obtain a writ of habeas corpus “returnable before the nearest tribunal in the fifth judicial circuit authorised to hear, and determine, writs of habeas corpus.”514 Clayton, meanwhile, returned to Nauvoo for help. By 29 June, horsemen from Nauvoo intercepted JS and his arresters and JS convinced his lawyers that his writ of habeas corpus should be heard in the Nauvoo Municipal Court.
Richards, in Nauvoo, recorded the little information he received about these proceedings in JS’s journal, along with his direct observations of other events that transpired in Nauvoo during JS’s absence. Richards resumed more detailed accounts of JS’s activities on 30 June 1843, when JS returned to Nauvoo.
