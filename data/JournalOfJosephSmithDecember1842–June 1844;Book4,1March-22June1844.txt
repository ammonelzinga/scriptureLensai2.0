Book 4, 1 March–22 June 1844
Editorial Note
The last of the four memorandum books kept as JS’s journal by Willard Richards covers a little less than four months and ends five days before JS’s death. Prominent among the events that Richards recorded during this time is the organization of the Council of Fifty and its efforts both to obtain redress for the losses church members had sustained in Missouri and to locate a new place of gathering, possibly where the Saints could have a government of their own. Other noteworthy topics include JS’s presidential campaign and his famous “King Follett” discourse, the latter of which contains some of JS’s most significant teachings concerning the nature of God and humankind. As the journal proceeds, more and more space is devoted to JS’s dealings with various dissenters, whose efforts to discredit the Mormon leader culminated in the publication of a newspaper, the Nauvoo Expositor, which detailed their disapproval of JS’s teachings and practices. When the Nauvoo City Council decided to have the press that published the Expositor destroyed, Richards recorded the event, as well as the backlash that decision engendered both within and without Nauvoo, Illinois. The last entries in the journal are almost entirely devoted to chronicling JS’s efforts to defuse the situation, keep Illinois governor Thomas Ford apprised of the growing threats against him and his followers, and prepare Nauvoo for possible attack. Brief references in the journal to events and documents (such as court cases, letters, affidavits, meetings, speeches, and the like) generated by these incidents in JS’s last months have required more explanatory annotation at some points in this section than was generally necessary for earlier journal entries reproduced in this volume. Expanded annotation is also needed at times to address the proliferation of sources created by early church historians who carefully documented the events leading to JS’s death.
Richards evidently left this journal behind when he, JS, Hyrum Smith, and Orrin Porter Rockwell left Nauvoo for Iowa Territory the night of 22–23 June, but he recorded JS’s activities for the next five days in his own journal, which is included as Appendix 3.

Wednedy [Wednesday] March 6— 1844 went to my office from there with [William W.] Phelps to [David] Bryants to see him about his uniting with [Hiram] Kimball and other to stay the o[r]dinance of the city17 [13 lines blank] [p. [8]]

Thursday March 7th 1844. 9. A.M. [15 lines blank] [p. [9]]
I <​Joseph​> presented to the meeting18 the proceedings of O[rsamus] F Bostwick. & the Lawyers &c.—19 for the people to speak out. say whether such men should be. tolerated. and supported in our midst.— and from this time I design to bring such characters before the committee of the whole.— and if these things cannot be put a stop to. I will give them in to the hands of the mob—— the hands of the officers of the <​city​> fauter [falter]. and are palsied— <​by the conduct of such men.​>
There is another I will speak about he is a mormon.— a certain man. who lived here before we came here. the two first lette[r]s of his [p. [10]] name is are Hiram Kimball—— when the city had passd an ordnanc [ordinance] to tax steam boats. He goes and tells th[e] captains of the steam boats that he owned the landing. and they need need not to pax [pay] tax—20 and I am determnd to use up such men if they will not stop their oppositi[o]n If this is not true. Let him come forward & throw of[f] the inputation [imputation].— when they people appeal to carthage I will appeal to this people— the highest court— I despise the La[w]yers who ha[n]g on these law suits.—
Kimball. & [Arthur] Morrison say they own the wharfs. but the city own the wharrf—— 64 ft— fr[o]m high water mark from printing office to the no[r]thern limits of the city.—21 [p. [11]]
another. thing. I want to speak about the Lawyers— of this city.— I have good feelings & and I will reprove them— and the prophets always did say wo unto you ye Lawyers.—22 the Maratim [maritime] laws of the U.S. have ced[ed] up th[e] tolls wharfage &c. to th[e] respective corporations who have jurisdi[c]tion.23 &c——
Shallow drafts intoxicate th[e] brain &c—
<​Look at the reason.—​>
no vessel could land any where, if subj[e]ct to individuals laws.—— Co[r]poration owns the streets of th[e] city. and have a right to tax the Boats to make wharfs. th[e] same as to tax citizns to make roads— want evry man in this city to stay at home & let. the Boat Captai[n]s. [p. [12]] peace officers and e[ve]ry body alone.—
Ho[w] are we to keep peace in this city. & defend our. selves agist [against] mobs.— disgrace ev[er]y man. by preaching him on the house top, who will, who not be still. and mind their own business.— Let them alone. to use themselves up.—
a couple of merchants in this city. I was told by an old gentlman this morni[n]g <​who told me​> that the spirit of Mobocracy was almost subsiding.— These mercha[n]ts have as the people arboad [abroad] say.— told the people. that they need not bring butter eggs &c—— <​to Nauvoo​>24 will n[o]t tell their names. if they will not let the people bring in their produce.— the people will not buy their goods. [p. [13]]
another man. will not call his nam[e]. has been writing to th[e] new york Tribu[n]e some of the greatest most disgraceful— things possible to name.—25 he ha[s] statd in th[a]t article that there are a gr[e]at ma[n]y approp[r]iations— to the t[e]mple. appli[e]d some where else to.— to stigmatize th[e] Trustee & And tu[r]n prejudice agint [against] us abroad.— if any man who has appointed any thing.— old harness horses. waggon— &c <​let him come f[or]ward​> the fi[r]st farthing and we can[n]ot show where it has been appropiatd [appropriated]. I will give him my head for a foot ball.—
he also states that the Temple cannot be build it costs so [p. [14]] much.— who dont know. that we can put the roof on this buildi[n]g this season? by tur[n]ing all the means of the N. Hous [Nauvoo House] & doubli[n]g our diligen[ce] we can do it.26
The best way for such m[e]n is to be still. If I did not love men I woud not reprove them. but work in the dark as they do—— read the Tribun[e] & you see for yourself—27
he is not a Lawyer— he is nearer related to a Doctor. a small man.—28 “Mr McNiel— enquired if he was the man.—” No did not know you— you are a st[r]anger.—— Joseph rested.
Prest Hyrum [Smith]— spoke—— saying he wantd to make some observati[o]ns of a romantic turn.— The character of such men [p. [15]] ought to be. noted. by eve[r]y man.— Had a old country ferret them out. like rats &c— you could describe th[e]m as you would a Hedgehog.— in evry hedge <​hims[e]lf​> runni[n]g like the skunk.—— like pollywogs— run[n]ing about with tails.—— drop off— toads. &c— soul $5.00. gizzard29
Chas. Foster— asked. if Joseph meant. him Joseph said. I will ask you a qustin [question] <​That is no way. yes that is the way the Quakers do.—​> why did you denom[in]ate yourself <​Jesus said— whose image & supescriptin [superscription] is it—30 &c​>— did you me[a]n me.— why did you denmt [denominate] you[r]self.—— did <​then I unde[r]stand​> you meant me.— You said it.— You shall hear from me.— Mayor I fine you $10.00—— for that threat. and distubig [disturbing] the metig [meeting]
Doctor [Robert D.] Foster. spoke to palliate and exhort him to await— &c— [p. [16]]
doctor said he has not theated [threatened] you.— Joseph says he has—— Doctr no one has hea[r]d him th[r]eaten you— and hundreds cried I have.— Doctor continu[e]d to speak & mayor said stop <​order​> or I will fine you——
W[illiam] W. Phelps read Gen Smiths vi[e]ws of the power & polic[i]es of the gen[eral] Gover[n]ment.31 after which it was voted unanimously with one excepti[o]n, to uphold Gen Smith for the Presidny [presidency].
“A voice of Innocenc[e] from Nauvo[o]” was then read by. W W Phelps . . . — and all the people assembly said amen. Twice32
Doctor. Foster. read a letter from Thomas Ford Governor [p. [17]]
20 30 mitns [minutes] past 12. adjud [adjourned] till 2. P.M
2. P.M.— assembled. according to adjumnt [adjournment] Singing. & Prayer by O[rson] Pratt: singing—
President B[righam] Young. addressed the congregation to give his views on the Lawyers.— who fi[r]st arose among the childrn of Israel. to explain to the common people. I am a Lawyer in Israel. My busin[e]ss is to make peace am[o]ng the people,— and man who takes any other course is out of the line of his duty.— a Lawye[r’]s duty is tell what the Law is. and then let the people go and act upon— it: and let them rec[e]ive pay like any labrng [laboring] man—
It is desirable for justices of the peace. when men call for writs to inquir[e] into the cause [p. [18]] and till them how to settle.— and thus put down Law suits.——
to cure lawing. let us pay attention to our own business— when we hear a story never tell it again— and it will be a perfect cure.—
If your bro[ther] mistreats you let him alone. if your enemy cheats you. let it go.— cease to deal with men who abuse.— if all men had taken the cou[r]se that some have we should not have such men in our midst.— I have no obje[c]tions to any mans coming here. but this I will have nothing to do. with men who will abuse me at midnight and at noon day.— &c——
our difficulti[e]s and pescutions [persecutions] have always arisen from men right in our midst.—— It is the Lust of indiv[i]duals to rob us of evry thing and build them-selvs up— in on our division.—
I feel that I want that every man should stay, and lift <​up​> holy hands without wrath or subelty [subtlety]. [p. [19]]
to the men who own land here. do not think you can. sell your lands here & then go off and spend it in abusing the mormons.— Israel is the head and not the tale.—
I expect the saints are so anxious to Work and so ready to do right that God has whisperd to the prophet. build the Templle, and let the N[auvoo] House alone at present.— I would not sue a man if he owed me 500, or a thousand $.— and he came to me. and told me he would not pay.—
Bro [John] Taylor. said that it was said by some that the municipal offices. of the city were acting in an arbitrary manner.— &— which was false &c.— and went on to explain the prin[c]iples of democracy.—
Stopped awhile for a contribution to get [p. [20]] fuse and powder—33 a boat was coming dow[n] and the messinger was waiting to go to st Louis. collected 50 or 60 dollars
Bro Taylor continu[e]d his speech.— when soc[i]ety was first organizd they fou[n]d themselves without Legislatur congress house of Lords or anything of the kind.— except evry mans was Lord over his own house.34
diffi[c]ulties began to contend and combine together in Govennts [governments].— bye & bye som 2 or th[r]ee requ[es]ted they might return to th[e]ir original— customs and the Governm[en]t said they might.— this is the situati[o]n of this city. in the main. <​we asked for a cha[r]ter &c​>
Of Gen Smith. some are afraid. <​&​> think it doubtful about. his election. & like the Ostrich stick their heads under a bush & leave their bodi[e]s out.— and we can all see th[e]m and. after this it will a bye word th[a]t man is an Ostrich, who hides his head in this cause [p. [21]]
<​spoke also on the going on with the Temple​>
Prest Young spoke— may men who have not paid their proprty tith[i]ng35 we shall call on them & take dinner and we had rathr be saved that trouble.— and have th[e]m come up & pay.—
Elder [Reynolds] Cahoon said if anyone had any doubt about.— the state of the temple. let them call & see the Books.— & where thy they have paid their tiithig [tithing] show it entired [entered] on the book paid in full. for <​th[e]​> year &c36
Joseph— said in relation to thos[e] who give p[r]operty on the temple. be careful into <​whose​> hands it come into that it m[a]y be ente[re]d into the church books. that those whose names are found in the chu[r]ch book shall have the first claim. in that house.—37 I int[e]nd to keep the door at dedication myself: & not a man [p. [22]] shall pass who had not paid his bonus38
I do not care 1/2 so much about the Pres[idential] election as I do the office I have got we have. as good a right to make a political party to gain power to defend ourselves. as for mormons demagogu[e]s to make use of our religin to get power to destroy ours[e]lves.— we will whip the mob by getting up a presidnt.
when I look into the Eastern pape[r]s & see how popular I am I am [a]fraid I shall be presidnt.—39
on the annxatin [annexation] of Texas.—— some obj[e]ct— the anti-Mormns— are good fellows—. I say it in anticipation th[e]y will repent [p. [23]]
obj[e]ct to Texas on acco[u]nt of slavery.—40 Tis the very reason why she should be r[e]ceived.——
[Samuel] Houston. says [“]gentlmn if you refuse to receiv us we mu[s]t go to the British”41 and the first thing th[e]y will do will be to set the negroes free42 & Indians & th[e]y will use us up—
British officers running all over Texas to pick a quarrel with us.— more honorable for us to receve th[e]m. & set the negroes free & use the ngoes [negroes] & indians— agint [against] our foes.
dont let Texas go lest Our Mother & th[e] daughtrs of th[e] land. will laugh us [p. [24]] in the teeth.— and if these things are not so— god never spoke with by any prophet sinc[e] the world began.—
I. have been [blank]43
south hold the balanc[e] of power &c— by annexing Texas.— I can do away this evil— liberate 2 or 3 states. & if that was not suffic[ie]nt. call in Canida——
Send the negroes to Texas. fr[o]m Texas to mexico— where all colors are alike.—44
notice was given for th[e] relief society to meet satu[r]day 2. P M.— to adopt “the voice of Innocence fr[o]m Nauvo[o].”45

Every man has a right to be a false prophet. as well as a true prophet.—

all things God has seen fit proper to r[e]veal in while dwelli[n]g in mortality. are reveald.— precisely the same— as though we were destitute of bodies.——
what will save our spi[r]its will save our bodies.—— our taberacls [tabernacles]—— for our spi[r]its— All spi[r]its— who have not obedye [obeyed] th[e] Gospel must be damnd.—147 Who have not obeyed th[e] decrees of son of man.
we are looked upon by God as though we were in Eternity— the greate[s]t responibity [responsibility] resting upon us is to look after our dead.— they without us cann[o]t be made perfct without us. meet Paul 1/2 way.—148

Editorial Note
On 14 June 1844, JS’s clerk and confidante William Clayton began a record, centered on JS and his activities, that parallels Willard Richards’s official JS diary. Whether Clayton kept this account on his own initiative or by assignment is unknown, but JS is clearly the subject of the entries, which are different and apart from the entries in Clayton’s own diary. Like JS’s diary that Richards kept, Clayton’s record ends with an entry for 22 June, the day before JS left Nauvoo, Illinois, for Iowa Territory to avoid arrest. Several of Clayton’s entries for JS’s final week in Nauvoo contain more detail than the corresponding entries in the diary featured here, and the entire record is an important firsthand account of JS’s activities during the nine days that preceded his departure. Clayton’s record is reproduced in Appendix 4.

Editorial Note
JS’s journal ends with the 22 June 1844 entry. A letter JS received from Illinois governor Thomas Ford late in the evening of 22 June, along with JS’s response to that letter, clarifies JS’s situation at the close of the journal. Ford wrote that after careful examination, he felt that it could be “safely assumed, that the immediate cause of the existing excitement, is the distruction of the press and fixtures of the Nauvoo Expositor; and the Subsequent refusal of the individuals accused to be accountable therefor according to the general laws of this State; And the insisting on your parts to be accountable only before your own Municipal Court, And according to the ordinances of your City.” Ford characterized the destruction of the press as “a very gross outrage upon the laws and the liberties of the people” and charged JS and his associates with violating the constitutional provisions of freedom of the press and the guarantee against being deprived of “life liberty or property” without due process of law and a jury trial. The governor also accused the Nauvoo City Council of assuming “more power than . . . entitled to in relation to writs of habeas” and of taking upon itself judicial power that it did not have when it declared the press a nuisance. “In no other State, county, city Town, or Territory in the United States,” Ford asserted, had the idea that a newspaper could be “legally abated or removed as a nuisance” ever been considered.
Ford then insisted that all who were accused of destroying the Nauvoo Expositor press submit themselves “to be arrested by the Same Constable, by virtue of the same warrant and be tried before the same magistrate whose authority has heretofore been resisted”—referring to Thomas Morrison at Carthage. “You have made it necessary that a Posse should be assembled to execute legal process,” Ford said, and he warned that he would also call out the militia to arrest the accused if necessary. “I Sincerely hope that your people may do nothing which will make Such a proceeding necessary,” Ford continued, as he had “great fears” that militia officers would lose control of their troops in such an event and that Nauvoo would be destroyed and many Latter-day Saints killed. The governor closed his letter by guaranteeing the safety of anyone who came to Carthage either for trial or as a witness for the accused.557
According to William Clayton, Thomas Ford sent his letter by thirty “officers,” who told JS that they would wait until the following morning, 23 June, for JS and the others to prepare to accompany them to Carthage and that if “they were not then ready they should wait no longer but return & tell the governor they were resisted.” These thirty men may have been the posse referred to in Ford’s letter and mentioned in subsequent discussions and records. Ford, however, reported that he sent a constable and ten men to arrest JS. Whatever the number, the compilers of JS’s history reported that the posse did not arrive in Nauvoo until the morning of 23 June.558
In his response, JS told the governor that rather than insisting on being accountable only to the Nauvoo Municipal Court, he and others pled for habeas corpus “as a last resort,” seeing it as the only means by which they could save themselves “from being thrown into the power of the mobocrats.” JS defended the city council’s authority to declare the press a nuisance, referring to the Nauvoo charter and to William Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England. JS also cited a legal case in Ohio that revolved around the abatement of a press for libel to demonstrate precedence for the Nauvoo City Council’s actions. Their application of habeas corpus, similarly, had been made “in accordance with the Letter of the Charter, & Constitutin, as we confidently understnd them.— and that too with the ablest counsel.” Invoking constitutional protection against double jeopardy, JS also told Thomas Ford that those who had been accused of destroying the press had been examined and discharged by Hancock County justice of the peace Daniel H. Wells. “But notwithstanding this,” he continued, “we would not hissitate to stand another trial according to your Excellencys wish, were it not that we are confident our lives would be in danger, we dare not come.” In addition, JS told the governor that upon receipt of his letter, martial law had been lifted from Nauvoo and that JS and others, on the advice of “legal & high minded Gentlemn from abroad,” would be leaving Nauvoo immediately to lay their case before the federal government, “as the appernc [appearance] of things is not only treasonabl ag[ai]nst us, but againt this state on the part of Missouri.” “If any thing wrong has been done on our part, and we know of nothing,” JS closed, “we will make all things right. if the governmnt will give us the oppor[tu]nity, disperse the mob and secure to us our constitinal [constitutional] privileges— that are lives may not be endangered—when on trial.”559
JS, Hyrum Smith, Willard Richards, and Orrin Porter Rockwell left Nauvoo during the night, crossed the Mississippi River, and arrived in Iowa Territory the following morning. According to William Clayton, JS left Nauvoo “rather than resist the officers & Militia or go to Carthage.” In a letter to his wife on 23 June, JS wrote that he did not know where he would go or what he would do, but that “if possible” he would “endeavor to get to the city of Washington.” In an account based on reminiscent sources and clearly influenced by intervening events, compilers of JS’s history later wrote that he left Nauvoo for “the Great Basin in the Rocky Mountains”560 after instructing William W. Phelps “to commence petitioning the President of the United States and Congress for redress of grievances, and see if they would grant the Church liberty and equal rights.”561
For Willard Richards’s detailed account of JS’s activities between 23 and 27 June 1844, see Appendix 3.
