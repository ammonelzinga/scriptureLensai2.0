Book 1, 21 December 1842–10 March 1843
Editorial Note
Approximately half of Willard Richards’s memorandum book 1 focuses on two incidents: JS’s effort to avoid extradition to Missouri to face charges of involvement in the shooting of Missouri’s former governor Lilburn W. Boggs, and a malpractice suit involving a Nauvoo doctor and his patient in the mayor’s court. The reports of the malpractice trial, recorded in this journal and published in The Wasp,1 are the most extensive accounts of any case over which JS presided as judge. Also included in book 1 are reports of three JS sermons and of a variety of JS’s daily activities connected with his responsibilities as mayor, municipal court judge, militia commander, church leader, and family man.

Over the course of the next two weeks, JS and several others traveled to Springfield, Illinois, where JS obtained a writ of habeas corpus and was discharged from arrest for his alleged involvement in the attempted assassination of former Missouri governor Lilburn W. Boggs. JS traveled to Springfield in custody of Wilson Law, who held him by authority of the September 1842 proclamation issued by former Illinois governor Thomas Carlin,23 the original arrest warrant having been retained by Adams County undersheriff Thomas King.

Editorial Note
Willard Richards’s scanty notes recorded here in JS’s journal are the only record known to have been made during this 4 January 1843 habeas corpus hearing.144 The hearing debate centered on Illinois attorney general Josiah Lamborn’s two objections to the proceedings: first, that extradition was a state matter and, therefore, that the federal court had no jurisdiction; and second, that evidence concerning guilt or innocence could not be heard on habeas corpus. Justin Butterfield challenged these objections by arguing first that the United States circuit court not only had jurisdiction in the case but under the circumstances had exclusive jurisdiction, since extradition is a matter between two states; and second, that presenting evidence concerning JS’s whereabouts on 6 May 1842 did not establish guilt or innocence but rather that JS was not a fugitive from justice. For JS’s case to fall within the purview of extradition law, he first had to be a fugitive.145
Butterfield then showed the illegality of the documents used to arrest JS. He pointed out that Lilburn W. Boggs’s affidavit said nothing about JS having fled from justice in Missouri and that Missouri governor Thomas Reynolds had misrepresented the wording of the affidavit in demanding extradition. Boggs’s affidavit simply said that JS was “accessary before the fact” and that he was a “resident of Illinois.” Reynolds added that it had been represented to him that JS was “a fugitive from justice.” Butterfield pointed out that JS had not been in Missouri since sometime before the attempt on Boggs’s life and therefore that neither Boggs nor Reynolds had grounds to demand JS’s extradition.146

Editorial Note
Willard Richards’s disjointed phrases in the following entry reflect his efforts to capture Judge Nathaniel Pope’s decision as it was given.
In his decision, Judge Pope agreed with Justin Butterfield that extradition was a constitutional matter and that the federal circuit court was an appropriate venue for the hearing. To the objection of Illinois attorney general Josiah Lamborn that the court was not empowered to go behind the writ to look at the merits of the case, Pope stated that “the court deems it unnecessary to decide that point, inasmuch as it thinks Smith entitled to his discharge for defect in the [Lilburn W. Boggs] affidavit. To authorise the arrest in this case, the affidavit should have stated distinctly, 1st. That Smith had committed a crime. 2d. That he committed it in Missouri.
“It must appear that he fled from Missouri, to authorise the governor of Missouri [Thomas Reynolds] to demand him. . . . The governor of Missouri, in his demand, calls Smith a fugitive from justice . . . [and] expressly refers to the affidavit as his authority for that statement. Boggs, in his affidavit, does not call Smith a fugitive from justice, nor does he state a fact from which the governor had a right to infer it. Neither does the name of O. P. [Orrin Porter] Rockwell appear in the affidavit, nor does Boggs say Smith fled. Yet the governor says he fled to the state of Illinois. But Boggs only says he is a citizen or resident of the state of Illinois.
“For these reasons,” Pope concluded, “Smith must be discharged.”202

Taylor for Stealing— & Morgan for receiving— sentencd 6 months imprisonment in cartharge Jail.414 11 went to Temple. found Bro Hawes [Peter Haws] preaching about Nauvoo [p. [200]] house, Mr Wooworth [Lucien Woodworth]. spoke say something in vindicating my own character. commenced under peculiar circumstances.— have made all contra◊cts for Nauvoo house, was employed to build from the commencement. some brick on hand. most ready to start brick work one says “can you give me something to eat? I’ll try. another says I will have my pay. “go to hell & get it.” <​said I—​> I have set me down to a dry Johncake & cold water and the men who have workd with me no man shall go onto my povrty stricken foundation to build himself up. for I began it & will finish it, Not that public spirit here as in other cities dont deny revelation if the Temple and Nauvoo [p. [201]] house are not finished you must run— away.— when I have had a pou[n]d of meat or quart of meal I have divided with the workman.415 (pretty good Doctrin for paganism said Joseph)416 have had about 300 men on the Job— the best men in the world. those that have not complaind I want them to continue with me. & them who hate mormonism & every thing else that’s good. I want them to get their pay & run away
Joseph says417 well the pagan prophet has preached us a pretty good sermon thiss morni[n]g— to break off the yoke of oppressesion <​I dont know as I can better it much—​> and say what he is a mind to. [p. [202]]
for that the pagans and the pagan prophetts to feel more our prosperity is curious. I am almost converted to his doctrine, “he has prophecied if these buildings go down it will curse the place.” I verily know it is true. Let us build the templ. there may be some speculatins about Nauvoo house. say some— some say because we live on the hill we must build up this part on the hill.418 does that coat fit you Dr [Robert D.] Foster? pretty well! put it on then. this is the way people swell like the ox or toad.
They’l come down under the hill among little folks brother Joseph how I love you— and get up opposition. & sing419 names to strangers & scoundrels &c [p. [203]]
I want all men to feel for me. when I have shook the bush— & bore the burdn and if they do not—, I speak in420 authority
in the name the Lord <​god​> he shall be damnd,— people on the flats are aggrandiz[i]ng themselves. by the Nauvoo house.
who laid the foundation of the Temple. Bro Joseph in the name of the Lord. not for his aggrandizement but for the good of the whole
Our speculators say our poor folk on the flat are down & keep them down. How the Nauvoo house cheats this man & that man— say the speculators. they are fools ought to hide their heads in a hollow punkin & never take it out.— [p. [204]]
the fir[s]t principle brought into consideratio[n] is aggrandizement. some think it unlawful— but it is lawful while he has a disposition to aggrandize all around him. false principle, to aggrandize at the expence of another. every thing God does is to aggrandize his kingdom
how does he lay the foundation? build a temple to my great name. and call the attention of the great. but where shall we lay our heads an old log cabin
I will whip Hiram Kimball & Esqr [Daniel H.] Wells and every body else over Dr Fosters head, instead of building the Nauvoo house build a great many little skeletons see Dr Fosters mammoth skeletons [p. [205]] of Dr Foster421 rising all over town but there is no flesh on them. personal aggrandizement. dont care how many bones— somebody may come along & clothe them.— elephants. crocodiles &c eaters. such as grog shop &c— card shops &c— those who live in glass houses should not throw stones. The building of N[auvoo] House is just as sacred in my view as the Temple.422
I want the Nauvo[o] House bui[l]t it must be built, our salvation depends upon it. When men have done what they can or will for the temple. let them do what they can for the Nauvoo House. We never can accomplish our work at the expence [p. [206]] of another. There is a great deal of murmuring in the church— about me, but I dont care any thing about it. I like to hear it thunder. to hear the saints grumbling.— the growling dog get the sorest head. If any man is poor and afflicted. let him come and tell of it.— & not complain— or grumble
finishing Nauvoo House like a man finihig [finishing] a fight. if he gives up he is killd— if he holds out a little longer he may live— a story. a man who will whip his wife is a coward. & fought with a man who had whippd wife.—— still remembrd he was whipped his wife. & whipped him till he cried enough.— hang on to the [p. [207]] Nauvoo house thus & you will build it. & you will be on Pisagah [Pisgah] & the gr[e]at men who come will pile their gold & silver till you are weary of receivng them. & if you are not careful will be lifted up & fall and they will cover up & cloak all your former sins— & hide a multitude of sins.423 & shine forth fair as the sun &c424
those who have labord & cannot get your pay be patient, if you take the means which are set apart let him he will destroy themselves, [p. [208]]
if any man is hungry let him come to me & I will feed him at my table.
if any are hungry or naked dont take away the brick &c but come & tell. I will divide. & then if he is not satisfied I will kill kick his back side
there cannot be some fire without some smoke. well if the stories about Jose[ph] Smith are true. then the stories of J. C. Bennet. [John C. Bennett] are true about the Ladies of Nauvoo. Ladies that the Releif society was organized of those who are to be wifes to Jos Smith.425 Ladies you know whithr it is true. no use of living among hogs without a snout. this biting an[d] devouri[n]g each other.426 [p. [209]] for Gods sake stop it.
one thing more, political economy. our duty to concentrate that all our influence to make popular that which is sound & good. & unpopular that which is unsou[n]d Tis right <​politically​> for a man who has influe[n]ce to use it as well as for a man to who has no influ[en]ce to use his. from henceforth I will maintain all the influe[n]ce I can get. in relation to politics I will speak as a man in religion in authority. if a man lifts a dagger to kill me, I will lift my tongue.— when I last preached. heard such a [p. [210]] groani[n]g I thought of the paddy’s. ell [eel] when he tried to kill him could not contrive any way so he put it [in] the water to drown him. and as he began to came427 to— see said he what pain he is in how he wigles his tail.— the banks are failing & it is the privilige to say what a curency we want. gold & silver to build the Temple & Nauvoo house.428 we want your old nose rings & finger rings & brass ket[t]les no longer. if you have old raggs—429 watches. guns go & peddle them. & bring the hard metal. if we will do this by popular opinion you will have a sound currency. [p. [211]] send home banks notes.— & take no paper money. & let every man write his neighbor before he starts to get gold and Silver.— I have contemplated these things a long time, but the time has not come till now. to speak till now.
I would not do as the Nauvoo House committee430 has done. sell stock for an old stone house431 where all the people who live die. & put that stock into a mans ha[n]ds to go east and purchace goods Rags to come here & build up Mamoth bones with.
as a political Man in the [p. [212]] name of Old Joe Smith I command the Nauvoo commitee not to sell a share in the N[auvoo] House without the Gold or Silver, excuse bro [John] Snider he was in England. when they sold stock for stone house.—432 I leave it
the meeting was got up by N. Committe [Nauvoo House committee] the pagans.

Dr Foster remarked much good may grow out of a very little, and much good may come out of this. If any man accuses me of Exchanging N[auvoo House] stock for Rags &c. I gave a $1000 to this house. & $50 to relief so[c]iety & some to Fulmer434 to get stone to build Joseph house. & I might mean to build Joseph a house & you may build this. & I will help you I mean to profit this. & will divide the mammoth bones with you. I am guilty of all [p. [214]] I have been charged,— I have signed my letter name to a petition to have Wm H.

Editorial Note
The following two journal entries—for 2 and 3 March 1843—deal almost exclusively with a medical malpractice suit that was tried in the Nauvoo mayor’s court, over which JS presided. The case grew out of events that occurred on 22–24 October 1842 involving the plaintiff’s pregnant wife, Margaret Kennedy Dana, and the defendant, Dr. William Brink, a Thomsonian physician. The plaintiff, Charles Dana, charged Dr. Brink, who had been called to treat a fever in Margaret Dana, with causing premature childbirth by misdiagnosis and unjustifiable practices that left Margaret’s health impaired.466 Willard Richards, a Thomsonian doctor himself,467 devoted over forty pages of the journal to recording the arguments and testimony presented in the case—probably because of his professional interest in the medical details. Richards’s notes of the trial, although disjointed at times, also illustrate how JS and his associates understood and applied the law.
