Presidents Joseph Smith & Brigham Young &c.8 it was decided as follows;
“It remains for Almon Babbitt to offer satisfaction. if he wishes so to do, according to the minutes of the Conference, You are doubtless all well aware that all the stakes except those in Hancock, Co.— Illinois, & Lee county Iowa. were discontinued some time Since by the First Presidency, as published in the Times and Seasons;9 but as it appears that there are many in Kirtland who desire to remain there. and build up that place, and as you have made great exertions, according to your letter, to establish a printing press, & take care of the poor, &c. since that period, you may as well continue operations according to your designs. & go on with your printing, & do what you can in Righteousness to build up Kirtland but do not suffer yourselves to harbor the Idea that Kirtland will rise on the ruins of Nauvoo.10 It is the privilege of brethren emigrating from any quarter To come to this place, and it is not right to attempt to persuade those who desire it, to stop short,”

Verily thus saith the Lord unto my servants, William Marks, and N[ewel] K. Whitney; Let them settle up their business speedily and Journey from the land of Kirtland before I, the Lord, sendeth snow <​again​> upon the ground. Let them awake and arise, and come forth and not tarry for I the Lord commandeth it,— therefore, if they tarry it shall not be well with them. Let them repent of all their sins, and all their covetous desires before me saith the Lord; For what is property unto me saith the Lord. Let the properties of at Kirtland be turned out for debts saith the Lord, Let them go saith the Lord, and whatsoever remaineth. let it remain in your hands saith the Lord, for have I not the fowls of Heaven, and also the fish of the Sea, and the beasts of the Mountains? Have I not made the earth? <​Do I not hold the destinies of all the armies of the nations of the earth?​> Therefore will I not Make the solitary places to bud and <​to​> blossom, and bring forth in abundance saith the Lord? Is there not room enough upon the mountains of Adam Ondi Ahman, or upon the plains of Olea Shinihah, or the land where Adam dwelt, that you should not Covet that which is but the drop and neglect the more weighty matters. Therefore, come up hither, unto the Land of My people, even Zion. Let my Servant William Marks be faithful over a few things, and he shall be ruler over many things. Let him preside in the midst of my people, in the city Far West, and let him be blessed with the blessings of my people.— Let My Servant N. K. Whitney be ashamed of the Nicolitans47 and of all their secret abominations, and of all his littleness of soul before me saith the Lord, and come up unto the land of Adam ondi Ahman,48 and be a Bishop unto my people saith the Lord, not in name but in deed Saith the Lord. And again, Verily I say unto you I remember my Servant Oliver Grainger [Granger]. Behold, verily I say unto him, that his name shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation. forever and ever Saith the Lord; Therefore let him contend earnestly for the redemption of the First Presidency of My church Saith the Lord; and when he falls he shall rise again, for his sacrifice shall be more sacred to me than his increase saith the Lord; Therefore let him come up hither speedily unto the land of Zion, and in due time he shall be made a merchant unto my name saith the Lord for the benefit of my people; Therefore let no man despise my servant Oliver Grainger. but let the blessings. of my people be upon him forever and ever, Amen.
And. again I. say unto. you let all the Saints in the land of Kirtland remember the Lord their God, and mine house to preserve it holy, and to overthrow the money changers in mine own due time. Saith the Lord. [p. 56]

The New Year49
January— 1842 Thursday 6.— 50The New Year has been ushered in and continued thus far under the most favorable auspices. and the Saints seem to be influenced by a kind and indulgent Providence in their disposition & means; to rear the Temple of the most High God, anxiously looking forth to the completion thereof. as an event of the greatest importance to the Church & the world, Making the Saints in Zion to rejoice, and the Hypocrite & Sinner to tremble, Truly this is a day long to be remembered. by. the saints of the Last Days; A day in which the God of heaven has began to restore the ancient <​order​> of his Kingdom unto. his servants & his people: a day in which all things are concurring together to bring about the compl[e]tion of the fullness of the gospel, a fulness of the dispensation of Dispensations even the fulness of Times; a day in which God has began to make manifest & set in order in his church those things which have been, and those things, which the ancients prophets and wise men desired to see.— but deid [died] without beholding it. a day in which those things begin to be made manifest which have been hid from <​before​> the foundations of the world. & which Jehovah has promised should be made known in his own due time. unto his servants, to prepare. the earth for the return of his glory, even a celestial glory; and a kingdom of Priests & Kings to God & the Lamb forever. on Mount Zion.— or the hundred & forty & four thousand which whom John the Revelator. saw;51 which should come to pass. in the Restitution of all things, [17 lines blank] [p. 57]
Editorial Note
After moving in with JS and his family on 13 January 1843,52 Willard Richards was able to more closely observe and record JS’s daily activities than before. The heading “Journal of President Joseph” preceding the next entry may indicate that by this point Richards had written most of the retrospective entries he intended to record and that he had a better idea of his role as “Scribe for the private office of the President.”53

203“Verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Joseph by the voice of my Spirit, Hiram Kimball has been insinuating evil. & forming evil opinions against you with. others. & if he continue in them he & they shall be accursed. for I am the Lord thy God & will stand by thee & bless thee. Amen.”204
After the Election Joseph spoke at some length concerning the evil reports which were abroad in the city concerning himself— & the nec[e]ssity of counteracting the designs of our enemies. establishing a night 205watch &c. Where upon the mayor was authorized to establish a Night watch. by city ordinance,206
207Dr John C. Bennet. Ex mayor, was then called upon by the Mayor to state if he know knew ought against him.— When Dr Bennet replied “I know what I am about. & the heads of the church know what they are about. I expect: I have no difficulty with the heads of the church. I publicly avow that any one who has said that I have stated that General Joseph Smith has given me authority to hold illicit intercourse with women is a a Liar in the face of God. Those who have said it are damned Liars: they are infernal Liars. He neither never <​eithe[r]​> in public or private gave me any such authority or licence, & any person who states it is a Scoundrel & a Liar. I have heard it said that I should b[e]come a Seckond [Sampson] Avard by withdrawing from the church. & that I was at variance with the heads <​& should use an influence against them​> because I resignd the office of Mayor: [p. 122] This is false, I have no difficulty with the heads of the church & hope Intend to continue with you. & hope the time may come when I may be restored to full confidence. & fellowship. & my former standing in the chu[r]ch.208 & that my conduct may be such as to warrent my restoration.— & should the time ever come that I may have the opportunity to test my faith it will then be known whethr I am a true traitor or a true man.”
Josep[h]. will you please state difinitely whether you know any thing again[s]t my character either in public or private?
Answer by Gen Bennet, “I do not. in all my intercourse with General Smith. in public & in private he has been strictly virtuous.”209
Joseph then made some pertinent remarks before the council concerning those who had been guilty of circulating false reports &c & said 210“Let one twelve months see if Bro Joseph is not calld for to go to every part of the city to keep them out of their211 groves & I turn the keys upon them from this hour if they will not repent 212& stop their lyings & surmisings. Let God curse them. & let their tongu[e]s cleave unto the roofs of their mouth.213

Friday 15th. This A.M. early a report was in circulation that O. P. [Orson Pratt] was missing. A. letter of his writing was found directed to his wife stating to the effect that he was going away;282 Soon as this was known Joseph summoned the principal men of the city and workmen on the Temple to meet at the Temple Grove where he ordered them to proceed immediately throughout the city in search of him lest he should have laid voilent [violent] hands on himself. After considerable search had been made but to no effect a meeting was called at the Grove where Joseph stated before the public a general outline of J[ohn] C. Bennetts conduct and especially with regard to Sis P [Sarah Bates Pratt] Met again in the P.M. when Hyrum [Smith] & H[eber] C. Kimball spake on the same subject after which Joseph arose and said that he would state to those present some things which he had heard respecting Edward & D[avid] Kilbourn being conspiring with J. C. Bennett in endeavoring to bring [p. 127] a Mob upon us, and as Mr E. Kilbourn was then present he would have the privilege of either admitting or denying it. Question by E. Kilbourn “Who did Bennett tell that I and my brother were conspiring to bring a mob upon you” Answer by Joseph “He told me and he told [blank] Allred283 and Orson Pratts wife & others”. Q by E Kilboun “Where did he say we were going to bring a mob from”. Ans. by Joseph. “From Galena”. Mr. Kilbourn then arose and said, “I was conversing with my brother this morning and he said he had never seen Bennett since he had us before him last year for conspiracy.284 I have only seen him twice since last fall, I saw <​him​> once then. I was going to Galena about 2 weeks ago. The Boat I was on stopped at the upper Landing place and I came ashore a little while. The first person I saw was Bennett; we entered into conversation, but there was no mention made of mobs. I have not seen him since. I always regarded Bennett the same as I regard you (Joseph) and thought you were pretty well matched. If any one says that I have conspired to bring a Mob upon you it is false”.285 The meeting was then peaceably dismissed. O. P. returned at night. He was seen about 2 miles this side Warsaw; set on a log. He says he has concluded to do right.286

Monday 8th. This A.M the Deputy Sheriff of Adams county in company with two other officers295 came with a warrant from Governor [Thomas] Carlin296 and arrested Joseph and O. P. [Orrin Porter] Rockwell. the latter being charged with shooting ex-Governor [Lilburn W.] Boggs of Missouri with intent to kill on the evening of the 6th. of May last and Joseph with being accessary. The city council convened immediately and issued a writ of Habeus Corpus to stop them from taking Joseph & Rockwell away without a trial here.297 The Deputy Sheriff hesitated complying with the writ of Habeus Corpus for some time on the ground (as he said) of not knowing wether this city had authority to issue such writ but after much consultation on the subject they finally agreed to leave the prisoners in the hands of the city Marshall298 and returned to Quincy to ascertain from the Governor wether our charter gave the city jurisdiction over the case
Received a letter from Post Office which had been broke open and was much grieved at the meanness of its contents.

Wednesday 10th. The Deputy Sheriff returned but could not find Joseph. He endeavoured to alarm sister Emma & the Brethren by his threats, but could not do it they understanding the nature of the Law in that case.300
 11 August 1842 • Thursday
Thursday 11th. This A.M. brother Wm. Law entered into conversation with the Deputy upon the illegallity of the whole proceedings in reference to the arrest. After some remarks from both parties the Sherif acknowledged that he believed Joseph was innocent and that Governor [Thomas] Carlins course which he had pursued was unjustifiable and illegal. During the day Joseph who was at this time at Uncle John Smiths in Zarahemla sent word that he wished to see Sister Emma bro’s Hyrum Smith, Wm. Law and others, with instructions to meet on the island between Nauvoo and Montrose after Dark. Whereupon Emma, Hyrum, Wm. Law, N[ewel] K. Whitney, George Miller, Wm. Clayton & Dimick B. Huntington met at the water side near the Bricks Store sometime after dark and proceeded in a Skiff to the islands. We proceeded between the islands untill we arrived near the lower end; and then hauled to shore. After waiting a very little while, the skiff arrived from the opposite shore, and in it; Joseph and bro. [Erastus] Derby. A council was then held in the skiffs, and various statements set forth in regard to the state of things. It was ascertained that the Governor of Iowa,301 had issued a Warrant for the apprehension of Joseph, and O. P. [Orrin Porter] Rockwell;302 and that the sheriff of Lee County,303 was expected down immediately. Very strong evidence was also manifested that Governor [Thomas] Reynolds of Missouri was not acquainted with these proceedings. That Ex-Governor [Lilburn W.] Boggs had made oath before a justice of the peace or a Judge and that the Judge had made the requisition and not Governor Reynolds.304 Also that the writ issued by Carlin was illigal and unjustifiable305 [p. 129]
It is very evident that the whole business is but another evidence of the effects of prejudice, and that it proceeds from a persecuting spirit; the parties having signified their determination to have Joseph taken to Missouri wether by legal or illegal means. It was finally concluded that Joseph should be taken up the river in a Skiff and be landed below the farm called Wiggans’ [Ebenezer Wiggins’s] farm and that he should proceed from thence to brother [Edward] Sayers306 and their abide for a season. This being concluded upon, the parties separated Joseph and brother Derby being rowed up the river by brother [Jonathan] Dunham and the remainder crossed over to Nauvoo. It was agreed that brother A[lbert] P. Rockwood should proceed up the River on shore unto the place where the skiff should stop and there light up two fires as a signal for stopping place. After the Boat had proceeded some distance above the city a fire was discovered on shore. It was concluded that it was the signal and they immediately rowed to shore. When near the shore one of the company hailed a person on the shore but received a very unsatisfactory answer, whereupon they turned about and put to the channel and upon coming near the middle of the river discovered two fires a little higher. They immediately steered towards the fires and was happy to find brother Rockwood awaiting their arrival. 307They then proceeded through the timber to brother Sayers’ house where they were very kindly received and made welcome.
Judge [James] Ralston and Lawyer [Stephen] Powers departed each for home expressing their perfect willingness to aid us in every possible manner. Judge Ralston also promised to ascertain the state of affairs in Quincy and give us the earliest information
 12 August 1842 • Friday
<​Friday 12th.​> This A.M. it appears still more evident that the whole course of proceedings by Governor [Thomas] Carlin and others is illegal. After some consultation with brother Wm. Law sister Emma concluded to dispatch a messenger with a letter to Lawyer [Stephen] Powers of Keokuk to request him to go to Burlington I. T. [Iowa Territory] and there see the Governor of Iowa and endeavor to ascertain a knowledge of the truth as to wether Gov. [Thomas] Reynolds had made any requisition on him for Joseph & [Orrin Porter] Rockwell.308 309Accordingly Josephs new horse which he rides was got ready and Wm. Walker proceeded to cross the river in sight of a number of persons. One cheif design in this proceedure was to draw the attention of the Sheriffs and public, away from all idea that Joseph was on the Nauvoo side of the river
At night W[illiam] Clayton & John D. Parker left Nauvoo after dark and went to see Joseph and found him chearful and in good spirits.
 13 August 1842 • Saturday
<​Saturday 13th.​> This A.M. a letter was received by President Hyrum [Smith] from brother [David] Hollister of Quincy310 stating that Gov. [Thomas] Carlin had said that his proceedings was not legal and he should not pursue the subject any further. The letter allso stated that [Edward] Ford (the agent to receive Joseph from the hands of the Sheriff and carry him to Missouri) had concluded to take the first Boat and start home: and that he was going to fetch a force from Missouri. All this it is thought is only a s[c]heme got up for the [p. 130] purpose of throwing us off our guard that they may thereby come unexpected and kidnap Joseph and carry him to Missouri.
In consequence of President Joseph requesting sister Emma to go and see him that they might consult together &c. She concluded to go in the carriage. But when the carriage was being got ready it attracted the attention of the Sheriff. and they kept a strict watch for some time. Seeing the difficulty of getting away undiscovered sister Emma concluded to go on foot to Mrs [Elizabeth Davis] Durphy’s and wait untill the carriage arrived. Accordingly the cover of the carriage being folded up to shew the Sheriffs that she was not in W. C. [William Clayton] & Lorain [Lorin] Walker started down the river— called at Durphys and then proceeded down the river without being discovered. We went about 4 miles the river road and then311 turned off towards the Prarie. We went round the city about 2 miles from the outskirts and turned into the timber again opposite the Wiggans’ [Ebenezer Wiggins’s] farm After we got within about a mile from brother [Edward] Sayers sister Emma left the carriage and proceeded on foot. We soon arrived at brother Sayers and was pleased to find President Joseph in good spirits, although somewhat sick. The carriage returned home after we left it.
A report came over the river that there is several small companies of men in Montrose, Nashville, Keokuk &c in search of Joseph. They saw his horse go down the river yesterday and was confident he was on that side. They swear they will have him. It is said there is a reward of thirteen hundred dollars offered for the apprehension and delivery of Joseph and [Orrin Porter] Rockwell and this is supposed to have induced them to search viz. to get the reward.
The sheriff and Deputy312 have uttered heavy threats several times saying that if they could not find Joseph they would lay the city in ashes They say they will tarry in the city a month but they will find him.
 14 August 1842 • Sunday
Sunday 14th. Spent the forenoon chiefly in conversation with sister Emma on various subjects, and in reading this history with her. Both felt in good spirits and were very chearful. Wrote the following orders to Major Gen.l Wilson Law who was reported to be duly elected to that office yesterday,313 as follows, viz.—
Head Quarters of Nauvoo Legion
Augt. 15— 1842
Major Gen. Law
Dr General—
I take this opportunity to give you some instructions how I wish you to act in case our persecutors should carry their pursuits so far as to tread upon our rights as free-born American Citizens. The orders which I am about to give you is the result of a long series of contemplation since I saw you.— I have come fully to the conclusion both since this last difficulty commenced, as before, that I never would suffer myself to go into the hands of the Missourians alive; and to go into the hands of the Officers of this state is nothing more nor less, than to go into the hands of the Missourians; for the whole farce has been gotten up, unlawfully and unconstitutionally, as well on the part of the Governor as others; by a mob spirit for the purpose of carrying out mob violence, to carry on mob tolerance in a religious persecution. I am determined therefore, to keep out of their hands, and thwart their designs if possible, that perhaps they may not urge the necessity of force and blood against their own fellow-citizens and loyal subjects; and become ashamed and withdraw their pursuits. But if they [p. 131]
should not do this and shall urge the necessity of force; and I if I by any means should be taken, these are therefore to command you forthwith, without delay, regardless of life or death to rescue me out of their hands. And further, to treat any pretensions to the contrary, unlawful and unconstitutional and as a mob got up for the purpose as religious persecution to take away the rights of men. And further, that our chartered rights and privileges shall be considered by us as holding the supremacy in the premises and shall be maintained; nothing short of the supreme court of this State, having authority to dis-annul them; and the Municipal Court having jurisdiction in my case. You will see therefore that the peace of the City of Nauvoo is kept, let who will endeavor to disturb it. You will see also that whenever any mob force or violence is used, on any citizen thereof, or that belongeth thereunto, you will see that that force or violence is immediately dispersed and brought to punishment; or meet it, and contest it at the point of the sword with firm and undaunted and unyeilding valor; and let them know that the spirit of of old seventysix; and of George Washington yet lives, and is contained in the bosoms and blood of the children of the fathers thereof. If there are any threats in the city let legal steps be taken on the part of those that make the threats: and let no man, woman or child be intimidated nor suffer it to be done. Nevertheless as I said in the first place we will take every measure that lays in our power and make every sacrifice that God or man could require at our hands to preserve the peace and safety of the people without colition. And if sacrificing my own liberty for months and years without stooping to the disgrace of Missouri persecution and violence, and [Thomas] Carlins mis-rule and corruption I bow to my fate with cheerfulness and all due deference in the consideration of the lives, safety and welfare of others. But if this policy cannot accomplish the desired object; let our charter, and our Municipality; free trade and Sailors rights be our motto, and go a-head David Crockett like, and lay down our lives like men, and defend ourselves to the best advantage we can to the very last. You are therefore, hereby authorised and commanded, by virtue of the authority which I hold, and commission granted me by the Executive of this State, to maintain the very letter and spirit of the above contents of this letter to the very best of your ability; to the extent of our lives, and our fortunes; and to the lives and the fortunes of the [Nauvoo] Legion; as also all those who may volunteer their lives and their fortunes with ours; for the defence of our wives, our children, our fathers and our mothers; our homes; our grave yards, and our tombs; and our dead and their tombstones, and our dear bought American liberties with the blood of our fathers, and all that is dear and sacred to man. Shall we shrink at the onset? No, let every mans brow be as the face of a Lion; let his heart be unshaken as the mighty oak, and his knee confirmed as the sappline [sapling] of the forrest; and by the voice and loud roar of the cannon; and the loud peals and thundering of Artillery; and by the voice of the thunderings of heaven as upon mount Sinai; and by the voice of the Heavenly Hosts; and by the voice of the Eternal God; and by the voice of innocent blood; and by the voice of innocence; and by the voice [p. 132]
of all that is sacred and dear to man, let us plead the justice of our cause; trusting in the arm of Jehovah the Eloheem who sits enthroned in the heavens: that peradventure he may give us the victory; and if we bleed we shall bleed in a good cause— in the cause of innocence and truth: and from henceforth will their not be a crown of glory for us? And will not those who come after us, hold our names in sacred remembrance? and will our enemies dare to brand us with cowardly reproach? With these considerations, I subscribe myself Yours most faithfully and respectfully with acknowledgements of your high and honored trusts as Major Gen. of the Nauvoo Legion
Joseph Smith— Mayor of the City of Nauvoo
and Lieut Gen. of the Nauvoo Legion of Illinois. Militia
Wilson Law.
Major Gen. of the Nauvoo Legion.—
P.S. I want you to communicate all the information to me of all the transactions, as they are going on daily, in writing by the hand of my aidecamps. As I am not willing that any thing that goes from my hands to you should be made a public matter, I enjoin upon you to keep all things in your own bosom; and I want every thing that comes from you to come through my Aids. The bearer of this will be able to pilot them in a way that will not be prejudicial to my safety—
Joseph Smith.—314
This letter was put into the hands of Sister Emma with a charge to deliver it to Gen. Law tomorrow. After considerable conversation on various subjects and partaking of dinner Sister Emma accompanied by brother [Erastus] Derby & W[illiam] Clayton started for Nauvoo. The morning had been very wet and the roads was very dirty. It was difficult walking. We proceeded to the river and entered a skiff in which we proceeded across the river and then down the side of the islands Soon after we got on the water the wind began to blow very hard and it was with much difficulty and apparent danger that we could proceed. We continued on as well as we could and after considerable toil arrived opposite the City of Nauvoo. We went between the Islands and crossed over the river to Montrose As soon as we landed the wind abated and was near calm. Brother Derby wanted to return up the river without the additional toil of crossing to Nauvoo. We was fortunate in happening to meet with bro. Ivins315 skiff just about to go over to Nauvoo. We got into that skiff and left brother Derby to return at his own leasure. Before we could get over the wind arose again considerable but we arrived home safe and well about 6 o clock P.M. We found Mr [Stephen] Powers from Keokuk who had just returned from Burlington. While there he ascertained that there was no writ issued in Iowa for Joseph.316 The report had evidently originated from the fact of a writ being issued for the apprehension of some horse theives The people enquired if it was not true that Joseph had been commissioned by the United States to visit the Indians and negociate with them for a tract of land, such being the report in circulation. Mr Powers answered that he “was not authorised to assert that the report was true but he thought it was not only possible but very probable.[”]317 [p. 133]
 15 August 1842 • Monday
Monday 15th. This A.M. several reports were in circulation that the Militia are on their way here, and the same is said to have been stated by the Stage driver; but it is supposed that it is only as scheme to alarm the citizens. Sister Emma presented the forgoing letter to Major Gen. [Wilson] Law to which he responded by the following answer
“Nauvoo City Ill. Augt. 15th. Afternoon 1842
Lieut Gen. J. Smith
My Dr friend
I this morning received a line from you by the young man ([Lorin] Walker) respecting the Guns318 &c. One of them is in the stone Shop by the Nauvoo House. One I expect to get put into Mr Ivins’ barn and the other I cannot get under lock and key any place I know of yet; but I will have them taken the best care of that I can.
I have also received from the hand of your Lady your orders at len[g]th respecting matters and things, and I am happy indeed to receive such orders from you, for your views on these subjects are precisely my own. I do respond with my whole heart to every sentiment you have so nobly and so feelingly expressed, and while my heart beats, or this hand which now writes is able to draw and weild a sword you may depend on it being at your service in the glorious cause Liberty and Truth, ready in a moments warning to defends the rights of man both civil and religious. Our common rights and peace is all we ask and we will use every peaceable means in our power to enjoy these, but our rights we must have, peace we must have if we have to fight for them.— There has nothing worthy of notice come to my knowledge to day, the Gentlemen Officers are seemingly very unhappy and out of humor with themselves more than with any body else, they see we have the advantage of them and that the<​y​> can not provoke us to break the law, and I think they know if they do that we will use them up the right way. I guess they see that in our patience we possess our souls,319 and I know that if they shed or cause to be shed a drop of the blood of one of the least amongst us that the lives of the transgressors shall atone for it with the help of our God.— I send you the ordinance that was passed by the Court Martial on Saturday last for your approval or otherwise as it cannot become a Law without your approbation.320
I also send you the returns of the election for Major General,321 as you ordered the election,322 you will please order the War Secretary of the Legion (Col. Sloane [James Sloan]) to send for a Commission.323
With the warmest feelings of my heart I remain most respectfully,
Yours—
Wilson Law”
“P.S. Afternoon 6 o clock
I have just learned that Mr Pittman [James Pitman] got a letter about noon and got ready immediately and started off as he said for Carthage but I think for Quincy giving it up for a bad job
W. L”324
About dark brother Woolley325 returned from Carthage and stated that he had conversed with Chauncey Robison who informed him that he had ascertained that the Sheriffs were determined to have Joseph and if they could not succeed themselves they would bring a force sufficient to search every house in the [p. 134] City, and if they could not find him there they would search the state &c. As before stated the Sheriffs left the City about four o clock saying they were going to Carthage but brother Woolley did not meet them on the road. It is believed they are gone to Quincy. In consequence of these reports it was considered wisdom that some of the brethren should go and inform Joseph accordingly about 9 o clock Hyrum [Smith] Geo. Miller, Wm. Law, A[masa] Lyman, Jno D. Parker, N[ewel] K. Whitney & Wm. Clayton started by different routs, on foot and proceeded to the place where Joseph was. When the statement was made the president prepared to leave the city, expecting he was no longer safe, but upon hearing the whole statement from those present, he said he should not leave his present retreat326 yet, he did not think he was discovered, neither did he think he was any more unsafe than before He discovered a degree of excitement and agitation manifest in those who brought the report and he took occasion to gently reprove all present for letting report excite them, and advised them not to suffer themselves to be wrought upon by any report, but to maintain an even, undaunted mind Each one began to gather courage and all fears were soon subsided, and the greatest union and good feeling prevailed amongst all present.
Various subjects then was conversed upon and council given by the president which was felt to be both seasonable and salutary. After conversing a while in the grove the company retired into the house and sat and conversed untill 2 o clock at about which time they departed evidently satisfied and much encouraged by the interview It was considered wisdom that the president should have all things in readiness so that if it was necessary he could start immediately for the Pine Country327 where he would be beyond the reach of his pursuers.
 16 August 1842 • Tuesday
Tuesday 16th. Wrote a letter to sister Emma giving her instructions how to proceed in case he had to go to the Pine Country.328 Also wrote a letter to Wilson Law asking his opinion about the appearance of things and the best course to be pursued.329 Brother [Erastus] Derby took the letters and is expected back soon. Brother Erastus H Derby is one among the number of the faithful. souls, who have taken as yet the greatest interest that possibly could have been imagined for the welfare of president Joseph I therefore record the following blessing from the mouth of the president himself.
“Blessed is Brother Erastus H. Derby, and he shall be blessed of the Lord; he possesses a sober mind, and a faithful heart; the snares therefore that are subsequent to befall other men, who are treacherous and rotten-hearted, shall not come nigh unto his doors, but shall be far from the path of his feet. He loveth wisdom, and shall be found possessed of her. Let their be a crown of glory, and a diadem upon his head. Let the light of eternal Truth shine forth upon his understanding; let his name be had in everlasting remembrance; let the blessings of Jehovah be crowned upon his posterity after him, for he rendered me consolation, in the lonely places of my retreat: How good, and glorious, it has seemed unto me, to find pure and holy friends, who are faithful, just and true, and whose hearts fail not; and whose knees are confirmed and do not faulter; while they wait upon the Lord, in administering to my necessities; <​See Page 164​> [p. 135]
[pages 136–163, donation records dated 18 May–12 September 1842]
<​From Page 135​> in the day when the wrath of mine enemies was poured out upon me. In the name of the Lord, I feel in my heart to bless them, and to say in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth that these are the ones that shall inherit eternal life. I say it by virtue of the Holy Priesthood, and by the ministering of Holy Angels, and by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost. How glorious were my feelings when I met that faithful and friendly band, on the night of the eleventh on thursday, on the Island, at the mouth of the slough, between Zarahemla and Nauvoo. With what unspeakable delight, and what transports of joy swelled my bosom, when I took by the hand on that night, my beloved Emma, she that was my wife, even the wife of my youth; and the choice of my heart. Many were the re-vibrations of my mind when I contemplated for a moment the many passt scenes we had been called to pass through. The fatigues, and the toils, the sorrows, and sufferings, and the joys and consolations from time to time had strewed our paths and crowned our board. Oh! what a co-mingling of thought filled my mind for the moment, Again she <​is​> here, even in the seventh trouble,330 undaunted, firm and unwavering, unchangeable, affectionate Emma. There was brother Hyrum [Smith] who next took me by the hand, a natural brother; thought I to myself, brother Hyrum, what a faithful heart you have got. Oh, may the eternal Jehovah crown eternal blessings upon your head, as a reward for the care you have had for my soul. O how many are the sorrows have we shared together, and again we find ourselves shackled with the unrelenting hand of oppression. Hyrum, thy name shall be written in the Book of the Law of the Lord,331 for those who come after thee to look upon, that they may pattern after thy works. Said I to myself here is brother Newel K. Whitney also, how many scenes of sorrow, have strewed our paths together; and yet we meet once more to share again. Thou art a faithful friend in whom the afflicted sons of men can confide, with the most perfect safety. Let the blessings of the eternal be crowned also upon his head; how warm that heart! how anxious that soul! for the welfare of one who has been cast out, and hated of almost all men. Brother Whitney, thou knowest not how strong those ties are, that bind my soul and heart to thee. My heart was overjoyed, as I took the faithful band by hand, that stood upon the shore one by one. Wm. Law, Wm. Clayton, Dimick B. Huntington, George Miller were there. The above names constituted the little group. I do not think to mention the particulars of the history of that sacred night, which shall forever be remembered by me. But the names of the faithful are what I wish to record in this place. These I have met in prosperity and they were my friends, I now meet them in adversity, and they are still my warmer friends. These love the God that I serve; they love the truths that I promulge; they love those virtuous, and those holy doctrines that I cherish in my bosom with the warmest feelings of my heart; and with that zeal which cannot be denied. I love friendship and truth; I love virtue [p. 164]
and Law; I love the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, and they are my brethren, and I shall live; and because I live, they shall live also. These are not the only ones, who have administered to my necessity; whom the Lord will bless. There is brother John D Parker, and brother Amasa Lyman, and brother Wilson Law, and brother Henry G. Sherwood, my heart feels to reciprocate the unweried kindnesses that have been bestowed upon me by these men. They are men of noble stature, of noble hands, and of noble deeds; possessing noble and daring, and giant hearts and souls. There is brother Joseph B. Nobles [Noble] also, I would call up in remembrance before the Lord. There is brother Samuel Smith, a natural brother; he is, even as Hyrum. There is brother Arthur Millikin also, who married my youngest sister, Lucy. He is a faithful, an honest, and an upright man. While I call up in remembrance before the Lord these men, I would be doing injustice to those who rowed me in the skiff up the river that night, after I parted with the lovely group; who brought me to this my safe and lonely and private retreat; brother Jonathon [Jonathan] Dunham and the other whose name I do not know.332 Many were the thoughts that swelled my aching heart, while they were toiling faithfully with their oars. The<​y​> complained not at hardship and fatigue to secure my safety. My heart would have been harder than an adamantine stone, if I had not have prayed for them, with anxious and fervent desire. I did so, and the still small voice whispered to my soul, these that share your toils with such faithful hearts, shall reigne with you in the kingdom of their God; but I parted with them in silence and came to my retreat. I hope I shall see them again that I may toil for them and administer to their comfort also. They shall not want a friend while I live. My heart shall love those; and my hands shall toil for those, who love and toil for me, and shall ever be found faithful to my friends. Shall I be ungrateful? verily no! God forbid![”]
The above are the words, and sentiments, that escaped the lips of President Joseph Smith on this the 16th. day of August A.D 1842, in relation to his friends;333 and has now quit speaking for the moment, but will continue the subject again.334
Wm. Clayton, Clerk.
 17 August 1842 • Wednesday
335Wednesday 17th.— This day president Joseph and brother [Erastus] Derby went out into the woods for exercise and were accidently discovered by a young man. Various questions were asked him concerning the public feeling, and situation of matters around to all which he answered promptly On being requested not to make it known where they were, he promised faithfully he would not and said time would tell wether he did or no.336
several rumors were afloat in the city, intimating that president Smiths retreat had been discovered, and that it was no longer safe for him to remain at brother [Edward] Sayers. consequently sister Emma went to see him at night and informed him of the report. It was considered wisdom that he should remove immediately and accordingly he departed in company with Emma and brother Derby and went to Carlos Grangers who lives on the North East part of the city. Here they were kindly recieved and wel-treated. [p. 165]
 19 August 1842 • Friday
Friday 19th. This evening President Joseph had a visit from his Aunt Temperance Mack Spent the day mostly in conversation and reading. At night went to the city and concluded to tarry at home untill something further transpired with regard to the designs of his persecutors.337
 20 August 1842 • Saturday
Saturday 20th. Spent the day in the large Room over the Store. Was considerable sick all day. In the evening had an interview with brother Hyrum [Smith], Wilson and William Law, N[ewel] K. Whitney, & George Miller a few hours, conversing on the illegality of the proceedings of our oppressors &c.
 21 August 1842 • Sunday
Sunday 21st. In the Room over the Store. To day Sidney Rigdon went to the grove near the Temple and there related before the congregation the following incident which took place in his family. He stated that his daughter Eliza [Elizabeth Rigdon] had been sick unto death all the skill of physicians having been of no avail. She continued to sink untill finally she appeared to die, and went cold. She continually wished to recover and expressed strong desires to live saying she did not want to die &c. He stated that she appeared to die three times and again recover. When she came to the last time she stated that she had something to say to her father, which was to the effect that he must be faithful in the cause, that this was the cause of truth &c. She also said that George W. Robinson had it in his heart to deny the faith but if he did it would be his damnation, Also that Nancy [Rigdon] had near denied the faith but if she did she would be damned.338 She also said that Jno C. Bennett was a wicked man. Elder Rigdon that then stated that he felt himself a new man, that his constitution was renewed and his system invigorated. He also bore testimony to the truth of the work; he said he had been in it a number of years and knew for himself that it was the work of God &c. He also said it had been stated that he had said Joseph was a fallen prophet; this he denied in the strongest terms.339 After he had got through president Hyrum [Smith] arose and spoke at great length and with great power. He cited Elder Rigdons mind back to the Revelation concerning him, that if he would move into the midst of the city and defend the truth he should be healed &c and showed that what Elder Rigdon felt in regard to the improvement in his his health was a fulfilment of the Revelation.340 He then went on to show the folly of any person’s attempting to overthrow or destroy Joseph and read from the Book of Mormon in various places concerning the Prophet who was prophecied should be raised up in the last days, setting forth the work he was destined to accomplish and that he had only just commenced; but inasmuch as we could plainly see that the former part of the prophecy had been literally fulfilled we might be assured that the latter part would also be fulfilled and that Joseph would live to accomplish the great things spoken concerning him, notwithstanding his enemies might diligently and continualy seek his destruction;341 hence the danger of any man’s lifting his hand against him, for whosoever did it, would surely come to destruction and could not prosper. He asked if it had not already been proven that this was the fact. and that all who had persecuted the prophet had come to disgrace and shame, and how should any man prosper whilst seeking to injure him whom God had blessed and promised to protect and concerning whom the prophets had prophecied that he should live to fulfil the work committed to him [p. 166]
He concluded his address by calling upon the saints to take courage and fear not, and also told Elder Rigdon that inasmuch as he had seen the mercy of the Lord exerted in his behalf that it was his duty to arise and stand in defence of the truth of and of innocence and of those who were being persecuted innocently and finally called for all those who were willing to support and uphold Joseph and who believed that he was doing his duty and was innocent of the charges &c to hold up their right hand whereupon almost every person present was seen with their hands elevated and their countenances beaming with joy. Afterwards he said if there were any who were opposed to Joseph and would not defend him let them manifest it by the same sign but there was not one opposing witness.
It is evident that this meeting was productive of great good and if there was any treachery and secret combinations of evil and designing characters present, the discourse was calculated to show them their true situation and danger and it is very probable would be the means of bringing them to their senses. The whole congregation appeared highly delighted and strengthened by the circumstance and seemed to be inspired with new zeal and courage. During the day Elder Rigdon went over to President Hyrums and conversed upon various subjects and it is evident he intends to arouse his energies and stand in defence of the truth if Satan do not again darken his mind and fill his heart with evil. Orson Pratt has also signified his intention of coming out in defence of the truth and go to preaching342 [25 lines blank] [p. 167]

343Quincy June 30eth 1842
Dear Sir
I have recieved by the last mail your letter of the 24 instant, in which you have thought proper to give me a Statement of charges against the conduct, and character, of Gen, John C Bennet[t] I can say that I regret that any individual should so far disgrace344 his obligations to his God, and to his fellow man, as to condesend to the commission of the crimes alledged in your letter to have been perpetrated by Gene[ra]l, Bennet, it is however in accordance with representations of his character, made to me more than two years since, and which I then felt constrained to believe ware true, since which time I have desired to have as little intercourse with him as possible, No resignation of his commishion as Mj General of the Nauvoo Legion, has reached me,345 Some weeks since I recieved a short note from him stating, that, you had reason to believe that a conspiracy was getting up in the state of Mo, for the purpose of mobing the Mormons at Nauvoo, and Kidnaping you, and taking you to that state, and requested to be informed in case of such mob, whether you would be protected by the authorities of this state &c to which I replied, that as all men ware held held ameanable to the Laws so in like maner the rights of all would be protected, and the dignity of the state maintained to the letter of the constitution and laws, the above is in substance the contents of his note to me and my reply to him, hoving [having] destroyed his letter as I considered it of no use— should it be returned <​retained​>,346
you state that you have heard that I have of late entertained unfavorable feelings towards you (the Mormons) as a people and especially so with regard to yourself &c &c. if this should be true, you would be pleased to know from me the reasons of such hostile feelings,
In reply I can in truth say that I do not entertain nor cherish hostile or revengeful feelings towards any man or set of men on Earth, but that I may have used strong expressions in reference to your self, at times— when my indignation has been some what aroused by repeated admonitions of my friends, (both before and since the attempt to assassinate ex Gov [Lilburn W.] Boggs) to be upon my guard, that you had prophesied that Boggs should die a violent death— and that I should die in a ditch all this however if347 true, I looked upon as idle boasting untill since the assassination of Boggs— and ever even since then in reference to my self, I cannot view it in any other light, because whatever your feelings may have been to-wards Boggs, the mere discharge of an official duty on my part enjoins enjoined upon me by the constitution and Laws, of this state, and of the United states could not possibly engender feelings of such deepe malignity, [p. 168]
be assured that this matter Gives me no uneasiness nor would the subject now have been mentioned had you not requested a reply to your enquiries. I have seen your denial of the prediction348 published in the Wasp349 attributed to you of the death (or assassination) of Gov Boggs, be that true or false, nothing has contributed more towards fixing the belief upon the public mind, that you had made such prediction than the repeated statements of a portion of your followers, that the maner of his death had been revealed to you, and their exultation that it must needs be fulfilled
In reference to your request to be advised how you should act in case a mob should come upon you, I should feel very much at a loss to recommend any course for you to adopt, other than a resort to the first Law of Nature, viz to defend your own rights, because ware I to advise a quiet submission on your part, I could not expect that you would fold your arms, and silently look on whilst those350 rights ware violated and outraged, as long as you have the power to protect them,351
I however have not the most distant thought that there exists at presant, any real caus for the aprehension of a Mob coming upon you, otherwise I should feel it my duty to endeavor to arrest it,
very respectfully your obedient servant

Dear Sir
your communication of the 25th instant353 together [with] the petitions of the citizens of the city of Nauvoo both male and female354 ware delivered to me last evening by Brevet Major General Wilson Law Allso a report of James Sloan Esq Sectry of the Nauvoo Legion of the procedings of a court Martial of Brevet Major Generals had upon charges prefered against Major General John C Bennett upon which trial the court found defendant guilty and sentenced him to be Cashiered355
all of which have been considered, In reply to your expressed aprehentions of— the posibility of an attack upon the peaceable inhabitants of the city of Nauvoo and vicinity; through the intreaguees and false representations of John C Bennett and others, and you[r] request that I would inssue [issue] official orders to you, to have the Nauvoo Legion <​in​> readiness to be caled out at a moments warning in defence of the peaceble citizens &c I must say that I cannot concieve of the least probability or scarcely posability of an attack of violence upon the citizens of Nauvoo from any quarter what ever and as uterly imposible that such attack is contemplated by any sufficient number of persons [p. 169]
to excite the least appearance356 of danger or injury, [and]357 whilst I should consider it my imperative duty to promptly take measures [to]358 suppress and repell any invasion by violence of the peoples rights, I nevertheless think that it is not my province to interpose my official authority gratuitously where no such exigency exists— From the late disclosures as made by Gen Bennett359 it is not strange that the citzens aprehension of the cit[i]zens of Nauvoo are excited, but so far as I can learn from the expression of public opinion, the excitement is confined to to the Mormons them selves, and only extends to the community at large as a matter of curiosity and wonder,
very respectfully your obedient servent

Beloved Brother and friend those few lines which I recieved from you writen on the 15th was to me like apples of Gold in pictures of Silver,361 I rejoice with exceding greate Joy to be associated in the high and responcible stations which wee hold whose mind and feelings and heart is so congenial with my own, I love that soul that is so nobly entabernacled in that clay of yours, may God Allmighty grant that it may be satiated with seeing a fullfilment of evry virtuous and manly desire that you possess, may wee be able to triumph Gloriously over those who seek our destruction and overthrow which I believe weee shall, the news you wrote me was more favorable than that which was communicated by the Brethren, they seamed a little agitated for my safety, and advised me for the pine cuntry362 but I succeded admirably calming all their fears, but nevertheless as I said in my former letter363 I was willing to exile myselfe for months and years if it would be for the safety and wellfare of the people, and I do not know but it would be as well for me to take a trip to the pine countries and remain untill arrangements can be made for my most perfect safety when I returned, these are there fore to confer with you on this subject as I want to have a concert of action in evry thing I do, if I knew that they would oppress me alone and let the rest of you dwell peac[e]ably and quietly, I think it would be the wisest plan to absent myself for a little season, if by that means wee could prevent the profusion [of]364 Blood,— Pleas write and give me your views <​mind​> on this <​that​> subject and all other information that has come to hand to day, and what are the signs of the times,— I have no news for I am where I cannot get any news <​much​> all is quiet and peacible around I [p. 170]

To the forgoing letter I received the following answers To Wit
Nauvoo City Illinois August 17th. 1842
Lieut Gen. J. Smith
Dear Friend— Every thing is moving along in the city in the usual tranquil & industrious manner, there is no change in the appearance of things that a common observer could see, although to one who knows & is acquaint with the countenances of the thinking few, it is evident that their minds are troubled more than common, and I know by myself that they can not help it, and why should it be otherwise when the Lords anointed is hunted like a Lion of forest by the most wicked & oppressive generation that has ever been since the days of the saviour of the world, indeed every movement of this generation reminds me of the history of the people who crucified Christ, it was nothing but mob law, mob rule and mob violence all the time, the only difference is that the Governors then were more just than the Governors now, they were willing to acquit innocent men, but our Governors now despise justice, garble and prevent the law, and join in with the mob in pursuit of innocent blood. I have been meditating on your communication of yesterday & will just add a thought or so on the subject, respecting particularly your going to the Pine country. I think I would not go there for some time if at all. I do not believe that an armed force will come upon us at all unless they get hold of you first & that we rescue you which we would do under any circumstances with the help of God, but I would rather do it within the limits of the city under the laws of the city, therefore I would think it better to Quarter in the city & not long in one place at once. I see no reason why you might not stay in safety within the city for months without any knowing it only those who ought & that as few as is necessary.
I must close for the present remaining as ever your affectionate friend and obedient servant
Wilson Law.
The following is the one designed especially as answers to President Josephs letter dated August 16th. but which through mistake was mislaid and consequently not recorded in the proper place [p. 171]
366Nauvoo City Ill. one o clock afternoon Augt. 16th. 1842
Lieut. Gen. J. Smith
My Dear Friend— I have just received and read yours of to day & hasten to reply. There is no movements of any kind going on to-day amongst the enemy as far as I can see which helps to strengthen me in my opinion of yesterday, but still it might be a calm before a storm and if so we will meet it when it comes.
You wish my opinion respecting your absenting yourself for some time from those friends that are dear to you as life, and to whom you are also as dear, & from the place and station to which you are call’d by Him who ruleth in the armies of heaven & amongst the inhabitants of the earth.367 I must confess that I feel almost unworthy to give an opinion on the subject, knowing that your own judgment is far superior to mine, but nevertheless you shall have it freely, it is this I think that if they cannot get you peaceably according to the forms of law, that they will not dare to attempt violence of any kind upon the inhabitants of the city, for they are well aware that they cannot insult us with impunity neither use violence only at the risk of their lives, and there are but few men, who are willing to risk their lives in a bad cause, it is the principles & spirit of Liberty, of Truth, of Virtue, & of Religion & equal rights, that make men courageous and valient & fearless in the day of battle and of strife; and just the contrary with the oppressor for nine times out of ten a bad cause will make a man a coward & he will flee when no man pursueth.368 Now if I am right in thinking that it is you alone they seek to destroy as soon as they find they can not get you, they will cease to trouble the city except with spies; and if we knew that you were completely out of their reach, we could either laugh at their folly, or whip them for impertinence or any thing else, as the case might be, for we would feel so happy in your safety that we could meet them in any shape. On the whole I think it would be better for you to absent yourself till the next Governor takes the Chair,369 for I do think if you are not here they will not attempt any violence on the city, and if they should they will disgrace themselves in the eyes of the world, and the world will justify us in fighting for our rights, and then you can come out like a Lion and lead your people to glory and to victory in the name of the Lord of Hosts. I know the sacrifice you must make in taking this course, I know it will grieve your noble spirit to do so, for when I think of it myself I feel no desire in life but to fight and to cut off from the earth all who oppress, and to establish that true form of government at once which would guarantee to every man equal rights. I know we have justice on our side in respect of city Laws, & that the acts of municipal court are legal, but the question is are we now able to assert them or had we better wait till we are more able. The latter course will give us peace a little while, by sacrificing your liberty and the feelings of your family and friends and depriving us all of your society and governing wisdom. I will only add that I am ready for either course and may God direct us to do that that is best. [p. 172]
If you should conclude to go away for a while I must see you before you go. And for the present I will bid you be chearful and make yourself as happy as you can for the right side of the wheel will soon be up again. And till then and ever I remain under every circumstance your friend &
Obt servant Wilson Law.
On the same day that the foregoing letter was wrote to Major Gen. Law.370 President Joseph wrote one to Mrs Emma in the words following To Wit;
Nauvoo August 16th. 1842
My Dear Emma
I embrace this opportunity to express to you some of my feelings this morning. First of all, I take the liberty to tender you my sincere thanks for the two interesting and consoling visits that you have made me during my almost exiled situation.371 Tongue can not express the gratitude of my heart, for the warm and true-hearted friendship you have manifested in these things toward me. The time has passed away since you left me, very agreeably; thus far, my mind being perfectly reconciled to my fate, let it be what it may. I have been kept from melancholy and dumps, by the kind-heartedness of brother [Erastus] Derby, and his interesting chit-chat from time to time, which has called my mind from the more strong contemplations of things, and subjects that would have preyed more earnestly upon my feelings. Last night—in the night—brother Hyrum [Smith], [George] Miller, [William] Law & others came to see us. They seemed much agitated, and expressed some fears in consequence of some manouverings and some flying reports which they had heard in relation to our safety; but after relating what it was, I was able to comprehend the whole matter to my entire satisfaction, and did not feel at all alarmed or uneasy. They think, however, that the Militia will be called out to search the city, and if this should be the case I would be much safer for the time being at a little distance off, untill Governor [Thomas] Carlin could get weary and be made ashamed of his corrupt and unhallowed pro-ceedings. I had supposed, however, that if there were any serious operations taking by the Governor; that Judge [James] Ralston or brother [David] Hollister would have notified us;372 and cannot believe that any thing very serious is to be apprehended, untill we obtain information from a source that can be relied on. I have consulted wether it is best for you to go to Quincy, and see the Governor; but on the whole, he is a fool; and the impressions that are suggested to my mind, are, that it will be of no use; and the more we notice him, and flatter him, the more eager he will be for our destruction.373 You may write to him, whatever you see proper, but to go and see him, I do not give my consent at present. Brother Miller again suggested to me the propriety of my accompanying him to the Pine woods, and then he return, and bring you [p. 173]
and the children. My mind will eternally revolt at every suggestion of that kind. More especially since the dream and vision that was manifested to me on the last night. My safety is with you, if you want to have it so. Any thing more or less than this cometh of evil. My feelings and council I think ought to be abided. If I go to the Pine country, you shall go along with me, and the children; and if you and the children go not with me, I dont go. I do not wish to exile myself for the sake of my own life, I would rather fight it out. It is for your sakes, therefore, that I would do such a thing. I will go with you then, in the same carriage and on Horse back, from time to time, as occasion may require; for I am not willing to trust you, in the hands of those who cannot feel the same interest for you, that I feel; to be subject to the caprice, temptations, or notions of any-body whatever. And I must say that I am pre-possessed somewhat, with the notion of going to the Pine Country any how; for I am tired of the mean, low, and unhallowed vulgarity, of some portions of the society in which we live; and I think if I could have a respite of about six months with my family, it would be a savor of life unto life, with my house. Nevertheless if it were possible I would like to live here in peace and wind up my business; but if it should be ascertained to a dead certainty that there is no other remedy, then we will round up our shoulders and cheerfully endure it; and this will be the plan. Let my horse, saddle, saddle-bags, and valice to put some shirts and clothing in, be sent to me. Let brother Derby and Miller take a horse and put it into my Buggy with a trunk containing my heavier cloths, shoes and Boots &c and let brother [John] Taylor accompany us to his fathers,374 and there we will tarry, taking every precaution to keep out of the hands of the enemy, untill you can arrive with the children. Let brother Hyrum bring you. Let Lorain [Lorin Walker] and brother [William] Clayton come along and bring all the writings and papers, books and histories, for we shall want a scribe in order that we may pour upon the world the truth like the Lava of Mount Vesuvius. Then, let all the goods, household furniture, cloths and Store Goods that can be procured be put on to the Boat, and let 20 or 30 of the best men that we can find be put on board to man it, and let them meet us at Prairie Du Chien; and from thence, we will wend our way like larks up the Mississippi untill the touring [towering?] mountains and rocks, shall reminds us of the places of our nativity, and shall look like safety and home; and then we will bid defiance to the world, to Carlin, [Lilburn W.] Boggs, [John C.] Bennett, and all their whorish whores, and motly clan, that [p. 174]
follow in their wake, Missouri not excepted; and until the damnation of hell rolls upon them, by the voice, and dread thunders, and trump of the eternal God; then, in that day will we not shout in the victory and be crowned with eternal joys, for the battles we have fought, having kept the faith and overcome the world. Tell the children that it is well with their father, as yet; and that he remains in fervent prayer to Almighty God for the safety of himself, and for you, and for them. Tell Mother Smith that it shall be well with her son, wether in life or in death; for thus saith the Lord God. Tell her that I remember her all the while, as well as Lucy [Smith Millikin] and all the rest; they all must be of good cheer. Tell Hyrum to be sure and not fail to carry out my instructions, but at the same time if the Militia does not come, and we should get any favorable information all may be well yet. Yours in haste, Your affectionate husband untill death, through all eternity forevermore
Joseph Smith
P.S. I want you to write to Lorenzo Wasson, and get him to make affidavit to all he knows about Bennett and forward it.375 I also want you to ascertain from Hyrum wether he will conform to what I have requested. And you must write me an answer per bearer, giving me all the news you have, and what is the appearance of things this morning
J.S.—
To the foregoing Mrs Emma returned the following answer per hand brother [Erastus] Derby.— To Wit;
Dear husband,
I am ready to go with you if you are obliged to leave; and Hyrum [Smith] says he will go with me. I shall make the best arrangements I can and be as well prepared as possible. But still I feel good confidence that you can be protected without leaving this country. There is more ways than one to take care of you, and I believe that you can still direct in your business concerns if we are all of us prudent in the matter. If it was pleasant weather I should contrive to see you this evening, but I dare not run to much of a risk on account of so many going to see you. General [James] Adams sends the propositions concerning his land, two dollars an acre, payments as follows, Assumption of Mortgage say about fourteen hundred, interest included. Taxes due, supposed about thirty dollars. Town property one thousand dollars. Balance, Money, payable in one, two, three and four years. Brother Derby will tell you all the information we have on hand. I think we we will have news from Quincy as soon as tomorrow.
Yours affectionately forever
Emma Smith.
Joseph Smith.— [p. 175]
According to the hint offered by President Joseph in his letter to Sister Emma she wrote the following letter to Governor [Thomas] Carlin which was dated August 16th. but ought to have been the 17th.—
Nauvoo August 16th. 1842
To His Excellency Governor [Thomas] Carlin.
Sir— It is with feelings of no ordinary cast that I have retired after the business of the day and evening too, to address your honor. I am at a loss how to commence; my mind is crowded with subjects to numerous to be contained in one letter. I find myself almost destitute of that confidence, necessary to address a person holding the authority of your dignified, and responsible office; and I would now offer, as an excuse for intruding upon your time and attention, the justice of my cause. Was my cause the interest of an individual or of a number of individuals; then, perhaps I might be justified in remaining silent. But it is not! Nor is it the pecuniary interest of a whole community alone, that prompts me again to appeal to your excellency.376 But dear sir, it is for the peace and safety of hundreds I may safely say, of this community, who are not guilty of any offense against the laws of the Country; and also the life of my husband; who has not committed any crime whatever; neither has he transgressed any of the laws, or any part of the constitution of the United States; neither has he at any time infringed upon the rights of any man, or of any class of men or community of any description. Need I say he is not guilty of the crime alleged against him by Governor [Lilburn W.] Boggs.
Indeed it does seem entirely superfluous for me, or any one of his friends in this place, to testify his innocence of that crime; when so many of the citizens of your place, and of many other places in this State, as well as in the Territory; do know positively that the statement of Governor Boggs377 is without the least shadow of truth; and we do know, and so do many others, that the prosecution against him, has been conducted in an illegal manner; and every act demonstrates the fact, that all the design of the prosecution, is to throw him into the power of his enemies; without the least ray of hope, that he would ever be allowed to obtain a fair trial, and that he would be inhumanly and ferociously murdered; no person having a knowledge of the existing circumstances, has one remaining doubt: and your honor will recollect that you said to me that you would not advise Mr Smith, ever to trust himself in Missouri. And dear Sir, you cannot for one moment indulge one unfriendly feeling towards him, if he abides by your council. Then sir, why is it that he should be thus cruelly pursued? why not give him the privilege of the laws of this State. When I reflect upon the many cruel and illegal operations of Lilburn [p. 176]
W. Boggs, and the consequent suffering of myself and family; and the incalculable losses and suffering of many hundreds who survived, and the many precious lives that were lost; all, the effect of unjust prejudice and misguided ambition, produced by misrepresentation and calumny, my bosom heaves with unutterable anguish. And who, that is as well acquainted with the facts as the people of the city of Quincy, would censure me, if I should say that my heart burned with just indignation, towards our calumniators, as well as the perpetrators of those horrid crimes. But how happy would I now be to pour out my full heart in gratitude to Gov. Boggs if he had rose up with the dignity and authority of the cheif executive of the State, and put down every illegal transaction, and protected the peaceable citizens, and enterprising emigrants, from the violence of plundering out-laws, who have ever been a disgrace to the State, and always will, so long as they go unpunished. Yes I say, how happy would I be to render him not only the gratitude of my own heart, but the cheering effusions of the joyous souls of fathers and mothers, of brothers and sisters, widows and orphans, who he might have saved by such a course, from now drooping under the withering hand of adversity, brought upon them by the persecutions of wicked and corrupt men. And now may I entreat your excellency to lighten the hand of oppression and persecution, which is laid upon me and my family, which materially affect the peace and welfare of this whole community; for let me assure you that there are many whole families that are entirely dependant upon the prosecution and success of Mr Smiths temporal business for their support. And if he is prevented from attending to the common avocations of life, who will employ those innocent, industrious poor people and provide for their wants. But my dear sir, when I recollect the interesting interview, I and my friends had with you when at your place, and the warm assurances you gave us of your friendship and legal protection, I cannot doubt for a moment your honorable sincerety; but do still expect you to consider our claims upon your protection from every encroachment upon our legal rights as loyal citizens as we always have been, still are, and are determined always to be a law abiding people; and I still assure myself that when you are fully acquainted with illegal proceedings practised against us in the suit of Gov. Boggs378 you will recall those writs which have been issued against Mr Smith and [Orrin Porter] Rockwell, as you must be aware that Mr Smith was not in Missouri, and of course he could not have left there; with many other considerations which if duly considered will justify Mr Smith in the course he has taken. And now I appeal to your excellency as I would unto a father, who is not only able but willing to shield me and mine from every unjust prosecution. I appeal to your sympathies [p. 177]
and beg you to spare me, and my helpless children. I beg you to spare my innocent children the heartrending sorrow of again seeing their father unjustly drag’ed to prison or to death. I appeal to your affections as a son and beg you to spare our aged mother,— the only surviving parent we have left,— the unsupportable affliction of seeing her son, who she knows to be innocent of the crimes laid to his charge, thrown again into the hands of his enemies who have so long sought for his life; in whose life and prosperity she only looks for the few remaining comforts she can enjoy. I entreat of your excellency to spare us these afflictions and many sufferings which cannot be uttered; and secure to yourself the pleasure of doing good, and vastly increasing human happiness; secure to yourself the benediction of the aged and the gratitude of the young and the blessing and veneration of the rising generation.
Respectfully your most obedient— Emma Smith.—
Sir I hope you will favor me with an answer379
E.S.—
This letter was sent to Quincy by brother Wm. Clayton who presented it to Gov. [Thomas] Carlin on Friday morning the 19th. Inst. in presence of Judge [James] Ralston.380 The Govr. read the letter with much attention apparently and when he got through he passed high encomiums on sister Emma and expressed astonishment at the judgement and talent manifest in the manner of her address, He presented the letter to Judge Ralston requesting him to read it. Gov. Carlin then proceeded to reiterate the same language as on a former occasion viz. that he was satisfied there was no excitement any where but in Nauvoo “amongst the Mormons themselves” all was quiet and no apprehension of trouble in other places so far as he was able to ascertain.381 He afterwards stated when conversing on another subject that “persons were offering their services every day either in person or by letter and held themselves in readiness to come against us whenever he should call upon them, but he never had had the least idea of calling out the Militia neither had he thought it necessary. There was evidently a contradiction in his assertions in the above instances and although he said “there was no excitement but amongst them Mormons” it is evident he knew better. He also said that it was his opinion that if president Joseph would give himself up to the Sheriff he would be honorably acquited and the matter would be ended; but on Judge Ralston asking how hee thought the president could go through the midst of his enemies without voilence being used towards him and if acquited how he was to get back? the Gov. was evidently at a loss what to say but made light of the matter as though he thought it might be easily done. He took great care to state that it was not his advice that Mr Smith should give himself up but thought it would be soonest decided. It appeared evident that we have no great things to expect from Carlin as it is evident he is no friend. He acknowledged his ignorance of the law touching the case in plain terms. [p. 178]
 23 August 1842 • Tuesday
Tuesday 23— This day president Joseph has renewed the subject of conversation, in relation to his faithful brethren, and friends in his own words;382 which I now proceed to record as follows;
“While I contemplate the virtues and the good qualifications and characterestics of the faithful few, which I am now recording in the Book of the Law of the Lord,383 of such as have stood by me in every hour of peril, for these fifteen long years past; say for instance; my aged and beloved brother Joseph Knights [Knight] Senr, who was among the number of the first to administer to my necessities, while I was laboring, in the commencement of the bringing forth of the work of the Lord, and of laying the foundation of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints: for fifteen years has he been faithful and true, and even handed, and exemplary and virtuous, and kind; never deviating to the right hand nor to the left. Behold he is a righteous man. May God Almighty lengthen out the old mans days; and may his trembling, tortured and broken body be renewed, and the vigor of health turn upon him; if it can be thy will, consistently, O God; and it shall be said of him by the sons of Zion, while there is one of them remaining; that this man, was a faithful man in Israel; therefore his name shall never be forgotten. There is his son Newel Knight and Joseph Knight [Jr.] whose names I record in the Book of the Law of the Lord, with unspeakable delight, for they are my friends. There are a numerous host of faithful souls, whose names I could wish to record in the Book of the Law of the Lord; but time and chance would fail. I will mention therefore only a few of them as emblematical of those who are to numerous to be written. But there is one man I would mention namely [Orrin] Porter Rockwell, who is now a fellow-wanderer with myself— an exile from his home because of the murderous deeds and infernal fiendish disposition of the indefatigable and unrelenting hand of the Missourians.384 He is an innocent and a noble boy; may God Almighty deliver him from the hands of his pursuers. He was an innocent and a noble child, and my soul loves him; Let this be recorded for ever and ever. Let the blessings of Salvation and honor be his portion. But as I said before, so say I again while I remember the faithful few who are now living, I would remember also the faithful of my friends who are dead, for they are many; and many are the acts of kindness, and paternal, and brotherly kindnesses which they have bestowed upon me. And since I have been hunted by the Missourians many are the scenes which have been called to my mind. Many thoughts have rolled through my head, and across my breast. I have remembered the scenes of my child-hood I have thought of my father who is dead; who died by disease which was brought upon him through suffering by the hands of ruthless mobs. He was a great and a good man. The envy of knaves and fools was heaped upon him, and this was his lot and portion all the days of his life. He was of noble stature, and possessed a high, and holy, and exalted, and a virtuous mind. His soul soared above all those mean [p. 179]
and grovelling principles that are so subsequent to the human heart. I now say, that he never did a mean act that might be said was ungenerous, in his life, to my knowledge. I loved my father and his memory; and the memory of his noble deeds, rest with ponderous weight upon my mind; and many of his kind and parental words to me, are written on the tablet of my heart.385 Sacred to me, are the thoughts which I cherish of the history of his life, that have rolled through my mind and has been implanted there, by my own observation since I was born. Sacred to me is his dust, and the spot where he is laid. Sacred to me is the tomb I have made to encircle o’er his head. that <​Let​> the memory of my father eternally live. Let the faults, and the follies Let his soul, or the Spirit my follies forgive. With him may I reign one day, in the mansions above; and tune up the Lyre of Anthems, of the eternal Jove. May the God that I love look down from above, and save me from my enemies here, and take me by the hand; that on Mount Zion I may stand and with my father crown me eternally there. Words and language, is inadequate to express the gratitude that I owe to God for having given me so honorable a parentage. My mother also is one of the noblest, and the best of all women. May God grant to prolong her days, and mine; that we may live to enjoy each others society long yet in the enjoyment of liberty, and to breath the free air. Alvin my oldest brother, I remember well the pangs of sorrow that swelled my youthful bosom and almost burst my aching <​tender​> heart, when he died. He was the oldest, and the noblest of my fathers family. He was one of the noblest of the sons of men: Shall his name not be recorded in this Book? Yes, Alvin; let it be had here, and be handed down upon these sacred pages, forever and ever. In him there was no guile. He lived without spot from the time he was a child. From the time of his birth, he never knew mirth. He was candid and sober and never would play; and minded his father, and mother, in toiling all day. He was one of the soberest of men and when he died the Angel of the Lord visited him in his last moments. These childish lines I record in remembrance of my child-hood scenes. My Brother Don Carloss [Don Carlos] Smith, whose name I desire to record also, was a noble boy. I never knew any fault in him. I never saw the first immoral act; or the first irreligious, or ignoble disposition in the child. From the time that he was born, till the time of his death; he was a lovely, a good natured, and a kind-hearted, and a virtuous and a faithful upright child. And where his soul goes let mine go also. He lays by the side of my father. Let my father, Don Carlos, and Alvin, and children that I have buried be brought and laid in the Tomb I have built.386 Let my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters be laid there also; and let it be called the Tomb of Joseph,387 a descendant of Jacob; and when I die, let me be gathered to the Tomb of my father.388 There are many souls, whom I have loved stronger than death; to them I have proved faithful; to them I [p. 180]
am determined to prove faithful, untill God calls me to resign up my breath. O, thou who seeeth, and knoweth the hearts of all men; thou eternal, omnipotent, omnicient, and omnipresent Jehovah, God; thou Eloheem, that sitteth, as sayeth the psalmist,389 enthroned in heaven; look down upon thy servant Joseph, at this time; and let faith on the name of thy Son Jesus Christ, to a greater degree than thy servant ever yet has enjoyed, be conferred upon him; even the faith of Elijah; and let the Lamp of eternal life, be lit up in his heart, never to be taken away; and let the words of eternal life, be poured upon the soul of thy servant; that he may know thy will, thy statutes, and thy commandments, and thy judgements to do them. As the dews upon Mount Hermon may the distillations of thy divine grace, glory and honor in the plenitude of thy mercy, and power and goodness be poured down upon the head of thy servant. O Lord God, my heavenly Father, shall it be in vain, that thy servant must needs be exiled from the midst of his friends; or be dragged from their bosoms, to clank in cold and iron chains; to be thrust within the dreary prison walls; to spend days of sorrow, and of grief and misery their [there], by the hand of an infuriated, insensed and infatuated foe; to glut their infernal and insatiable desire upon innocent blood; and for no other cause on the part of thy servant, than for the defence of innocence, and thou a just God will not hear his cry? O, no, thou wilt hear me; a child of woe, pertaining to this mortal life; because of sufferings here, but not for condemnation that shall come upon him in eternity; for thou knowest O God, the integrity of his heart. Thou hearest me, and I knew that thou wouldst hear me, and mine enemies shall not prevail; they all shall melt like wax before thy face; and as the mighty floods, and waters roar; so shall or as the billowing earth-quake’s, devouring gulf; or rolling Thunders loudest peal; or vivid, forked lightnings flash; or sound of the Arch-Angels trump; or voice of the Eternal God, shall the souls of my enemies be made to feel in an instant, suddenly; and shall be taken, and ensnared; and fall back-wards, and stumble in the ditch they have dug for my feet, and the feet of my friends; and perish in their own infamy and shame,— be thrust down to an eternal hell, for their murderous and hellish deeds.”390
After writing so much president Joseph left off speaking for the present but will continue the subject again. He had a very pleasant visit from mother Smith and aunt Temperance [Mack], who were evidently highly gratified to find him in good spirits and in good health notwithstanding his confinement and lack of exercise. After visiting awhile and hearing read some parts of the Book of the Law of the Lord391 they departed rejoicing in the blessing and favor of the Almighty.—
In the P.M. president Joseph received a few lines from sister Emma informing him that she would expect him home this evening believing that she could take care of him better at home than elsewhere. Accordingly soon after dark he started for home and arrived safe without being noticed by any person.392 All is quiet in the city.

Wednesday 24th. At home all day. Had a visit from brothers Whitney394 and Isaac Morley
 26 August 1842 • Friday
Thursday <​Friday​> 25th. <​26th.​> At home all day. In the evening in council with some of the Twelve and others, He gave some very important instructions upon the situation of matters, showing that it was necessary that the officers who could, should go abroad through the States; and inasmuch as a great excitement had been raised, through the community at large, by the falsehoods put in circulation by John C. Bennett and others it was wisdom in God that the Elders should go forth and deluge the States with a flood of truth;395 setting forth the mean, contemptible, persecuting conduct of ex-Governor [Lilburn W.] Boggs of Missouri and those connected with him in his mean, and corrupt proceedings in plain terms, so that the world might understand the abusive conduct of our enemies, and stamp it with indignation. He advised the Twelve to call a special conference on Monday next to give instructions to the Elders and call upon them to go forth upon this important mission, meantime, that all the affidavits concerning Bennetts conduct be taken and printed so that each Elder could be properly furnished with correct and weighty testimony to lay before the public.—396

Saturday 27th. In the large room over the Store with some of the Twelve and others who were preparing affidavits for the press.—
 28 August 1842 • Sunday
Sunday 28th. At home—
 29 August 1842 • Monday
Monday 29th. This being the appointed for the conference above referred to,397 the Elders assembled in the grove near the Temple about 10 o clock A.M. President Hyrum [Smith] introduced the object of the conference by stating
“that the people abroad had been excited by John C. Bennetts false statements and that letters had frequently been received inquiring concerning the true nature of said reports; in consequence of which it is thought wisdom in God that every Elder who can, should now go forth to every part of the United States, and take proper documents with them setting forth the truth as it is and also preach the gospel, repentance, baptism & salvation and tarry preaching untill they shall be called home. They must go wisely, humbly setting forth the truth as it is in God, and our persecutions, by which the tide of public feeling will be turned. There are many Elders here doing little and many people in the world who want to hear the truth. We want the official members to take their staff and go East, (not West) and if a mob should come here they will only have women and children to fight with. When you raise churches send the means you get to build the Temple, and get the people to take stock in the Nauvoo House. It is important that the Nauvoo House should be finished that we may have a suitable house wherein to entertain the great ones of the earth and teach them the truth.398 We want the Temple built that we may offer our oblations and where we can ask forgiveness of our sins every week, and forgive one another, and offer up our offering & get our endowment [p. 182]
The gospel will be turned from the gentiles to the Jews.399 Sometime ago almost every person was ordained, the purpose was to have you tried and ready and then to receive their blessings. Every one is wanted to be ready in two or three days, and expects there will be a liberal turnout.”
After president Hyrum had got nearly through president Joseph came up to the stand. The brethren were rejoiced to see him. He had not been seen for three weeks and his appearance amongst the brethren under present circumstances caused much animation and joy, it being unexpected. Some had supposed that he was gone to Europe and some to Washington; and some thought he was in the city, Every one rejoiced to see him one once more When president Hyrum had done speaking president Joseph got up and began his remarks by congratulating the brethren on the victory gained over the Missourians once more.
“He had told them formerly about fighting the Missourians, and about fighting alone. He had not fought them with the sword nor by carnal weapons; he had done it by stratagem or by outwitting them, and there had been no lives lost, and there would be no lives lost if they would hearken to his council. Up to this day God had given him wisdom to save the people who took council. None had ever been killed who abode by his council. At Hauns Mill the brethren went contrary to his council, if they had not there lives would have been spared.400 He has been in Nauvoo all the while, and outwitted Bennetts associates and attended to his own business in the City all the time. We want to whip the world mentally and they will whip themselves physically. The brethren cant have the tricks played upon them that were done at Kirtland and Far-west, they have seen enough of the tricks of their enemies and know better”. Orson Pratt has attempted to destroy himself,— caused all the City almost to go in search of him.401 Is it not enough to put down all the infernal influence of the Devil what we have felt and seen, handled and evidenced of this work of God? But the Devil had influence among the Jews to cause the death of Jesus Christ by hanging between heaven and earth. O. P [Orson Pratt] and others of the same class caused trouble by telling stories to people who would betray me and ‘they must believe these stories because his wife told him so’! I will live to trample on their ashes with the soles of my feet. I prophecy in the name of Jesus Christ that such shall not prosper, they shall be cut down in their own plans. They would deliver me up Judas like, but a small band of us shall overcome. We dont want or mean to fight with the sword of the flesh but we will fight with the broad Sword of the spirit. Our enemies say our Charter and Writs of Habeus Corpus are worth nothing.402 We say they came from the highest authority in the States, and we will hold to them. They cannot be disannulled or taken away.”
He then told the brethren what he was going to do, viz; to send all the Elders away and when the mob came there would only be women and children to fight and they would be ashamed, He said
“I dont want you to fight but to go and gather [p. 183]
tens, hundreds and thousands to fight for you. If oppression comes I will then shew them that there is a Moses and a Joshua amongst us; and I will fight them if they dont take off oppression from me, I will do as I have done this time, I will run into the woods. I will fight them in my own way. I will send bro. Hyrum to call conferences every where through-out the States, and let documents be taken along and show to the world the corrupt and oppressive <​conduct​> of [Lilburn W.] Boggs. [Thomas] Carlin and others, that the public may have the truth laid before them. Let the Twelve send all who will support the character of the Prophet— the Lords anointed. And if all who go will support my character I prophecy in the name of the Lord Jesus whose servant I am, that you will prosper in your missions. I have the whole plan of the kingdom before me, and no other person has. And as to all that Orson Pratt, Sidney Rigdon or George W. Robinson can do to prevent me I can kick them off my heels, as many as you can name, I know what will become of them”.403 He concluded his remarks by saying “I have the best of feelings towards my brethren since this last trouble began, but to the apostates and enemies I will give a lashing every oppertunity and I will curse them.”
During the whole of this address the feelings of the brethren was indiscribable and the greatest joy and good feeling imaginable was manifest. Orson Pratt set behind president Joseph all the time he was speaking. He looked serious and dejected, but did not betray the least signs of compunction or repentance.
About Three hundred and eighty of the brethren volunteered to go out immediately and it is probable they will nearly all be gone in two weeks404
 30 August 1842 • Tuesday
Tuesday 30th. At home all day—
 31 August 1842 • Wednesday
Wednesday 31st. At home in the A.M. In the P.M rode up to the Grove with his lady to attend the Female Relief Society’s meeting.—405

September Thursday 1st. In the A.M. in the large room over the Store, P.M. at home attending to business.406
 2 September 1842 • Friday
Friday 2nd. Spent the day at home. In the P.M. a report came to the effect the that the Sheriff with an armed force, was on his way to Nauvoo.
 3 September 1842 • Saturday
Saturday 3rd. In the A.M. at home in company with John Boynton. A letter was received from brother [David] Hollister407 to the effect that the Missourians were again on the move and that two requisitions were issued, one on the Governor of the this State and the other on the Governor of Iowa.408 There movements were represented as being very secret and resolute. Soon after 12 o clock [James] Pitman the Deputy Sheriff and two other men came into the house.409 It appeared that they had come up the river side and hitched their horses below the Nauvoo House and then proceeded on foot, undiscovered untill they got into the house. When they arrived president Joseph was in another apartment of the house eating dinner with his family. John Boynton happened to be the first person discovered by the Sheriffs and they began to ask him where Mr Smith was. He answered that he saw him [p. 184] early in the morning; but did not say that he had seen him since. While this conversation was passing, president Joseph passed out at the back door and through the corn in his garden to brother Newel K. Whitney’s. He went up stairs and undiscovered.410 Meantime Sister Emma went and conversed with the Sheriffs. Pitman said he wanted to search the house for Mr Smith. In answer to a question by sister Emma he said he had no Warrant authorising him to search but insisted upon searching the house. She did not refuse, and accordingly they searched through but to no effect. This is another testimony and evidence of the mean, corrupt, illegal proceedings of our enemies Notwithstanding the constitution of the United States says Article 4th. “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” Yet these men audaciously, impudently, and altogether illegally demanded, and searched the house of president Joseph, even without any warrant or authority whatever. Being satisfied that he was not in the house they departed. They appeared to be well armed, and no doubt intended to take him either dead or alive; which we afterwards heard they had said they would do; but the Almighty again delivered his servant from their blood-thirsty grasp. It is rumored that there are fifteen men in the city along with the Sheriffs and that they dined together to day at Amos Davis’s. Soon after Sun down Thos. King411 and another person arived at the house and demanded to search, which they immediately did; but finding nothing they also went towards Davis’s. Some of them was seen about afterwards but at about 10 o clock all was quiet. It is said that they started from Quincey yesterday expecting and fully determined to reach Nauvoo in the night and fall upon the house unawares but report says they lost the road, and got scattered away one from another, and could not get along untill daylight.412 This in all probability is true as they appeared much fatigued and complained of being weary and sore with riding. President Joseph, accompanied by brother Erastus H. Derby, left brother Whitneys about nine o clock; and went to brother Edward Hunters where he was welcomed and made comfortable by the family, and where he can be kept safe from the hands of his enemies.
I will now proceed to record the following letter from the Governor to Sister Emma dated
413“Quincy August 24th. 1842
“Dear Madam— Your letter of this date414 has just been handed to me which recalls to my mind your great solicitude in reference to the security and welfare of your husband; but I need not say it recalls to my mind the subject matter of your solicitude, because that subject except at short intervals, has not been absent from my mind. I can scarcely furnish you a justifiable apology for delaying a reply so long, but be assured Madam, it is not for want of regard for you, and your peace of mind, that I have postponed; but a crowd of public business, which has required [p. 185]
my whole time; together with very ill health since the receipt of your former letter, and it would be most gratifying to my feelings now, if due regard to public duty, would enable me to furnish such a reply as would fully conform to your wishes— but my duty in reference to all demands made by Executives of other States, for the surrender of fugitives from justice, appears to be plain and simple; consisting entirely of an executive, and not a judicial character leaving me no discretion— or adjudication, as to the innocence, or guilt, of persons so demanded and charged with crime, and it is plain that the constitution and laws of the united States in reference to fugitives from justice, presumes, and contemplates, that the laws of the several States, are ample to do justice to all who may be charged with crime. And the statute of this State simply requires, “That when ever the Executive of any other State, or of any Territory of the united States, shall demand of the executive of this State any person as a fugitive from justice, and shall have complied with the requisitions of the act of congress in that case made and provided, it shall be the duty of the executive of this State to issue his warrant under the seal of the State, to apprehend the said fugitive” &c.415 With the Constitution and laws before me, my duty is so plainly marked out, that it would be impossible to err, so long as I abstain from usurping the right of adjudication. I am aware that a strict enforcement of the laws by an executive,— or a rigid administration of them by a judicial tribunal, often results in hardship to those involved, and to you it doubtless appears to be peculiarly so, in the present case of Mr Smith. If however as you alledge, he is innocent of any crime, and the proceedings are illegal, it would be the more easy for him to procure an acquital. In reference to the remark you attribute to me that I “would not advise Mr Smith ever to trust himself in Missouri” I can only say— as I have heretofore said on many occasions that I never have entertained a doubt that if Mr Smith should submit to the laws of Missouri, that the utmost latitude would be allowed him in his defence, and the fullest justice done him, and I only intended to refer (in the remark made to you when at my house)416 to the rabble. and not to the laws of Missouri.
Very much has been attributed to me in reference to Genl Smith that is without foundation in truth, a knowledge of which fact, enable<​s​> me to receive what I hear as coming from him, with great allowance. In conclusion Dear Madam I feel conscious when I assure you, that all my official acts in reference to Mr Smith have been prompted by a strict sense of duty, and in discharge of that duty have studiously pursued that course, least likely to produce excitement and alarm, both in your community, and the surrounding public, and I will here add that I much regret being called upon to act at all, and that I hope he will submit to the laws, and that justice will ultimately be done. Be pleased to present my best respects to Mrs— [Amanda Barnes] Smith & Miss [Eliza R.] Snow your companions when at Quincy, and accept of my highest regard for yourself, and best wishes for your prosperity & happiness—
Your obedient servant Tho. Carlin.[”]
Mrs Emma Smith [p. 186]
To the foregoing letter Sister Emma sent the following by way of answer.
“Nauvoo August 27th. 1842
“To His Excellency Gov. Carlin
Dear Sir— I received your letter of the 24th. in due time, and now tender you the sincere gratitude of my heart, for the interest which you have felt in my peace and prosperity; and I assure you, that every act of kindness, and every word of consolation have been thankfully received and duly appreciated by my me and my friends also; and I much regret your ill health, and still hope that you will avail yourself of sufficient time to investigate our cause, and thoroughly acquaint yourself with the illegality of the prosecution instituted against Mr Smith.— And I now certify that Mr Smith, my self, nor any other person, to my knowledge, has ever, nor do we at this time wish your honor to swerve from your duty, as an executive, in the least. But we do believe that it is your duty to allow us in this place, the privileges and advantages guaranteed to us by the laws of this State and the United States; this is all we ask, and if we can enjoy these rights unmolested, it will be the ultimate end of all our ambition; and the result will be peace and prosperity to us and all the surrounding country, as far as we are concerned. Nor do we wish to take any undue advantage of any intricate technicalities of law; but honorably and honestly to fulfil all of the laws of this State, and of the United States, and then, in turn, to have the benifits resulting from an honorable execution of those laws.
And now, your Excellency will not consider me assuming any unbecoming dictation; but recollect that the many prosecutions that has been got up unjustly, and pursued illegaly against Mr Smith, instigated by selfish and irreligious motives, has obliged me to know something for myself; therefore, let me refer you to the eleventh Section of our city Charter. “All power is granted to the City council, to make, ordain, establish, and execute all ordinances, not repugnant to the constitution of the State or of the United States, or, as they may deem necessary for the peace and safety of said city.”417 Accordingly there is an ordinance passed by the City Council to prevent our people from being carried off by an illegal process.418 And if any one thinks he is illegally seized, under this ordinance he claims the right of Habeus Corpus under section 17th. of the charter, to try the question of identity, which is strictly constitutional.419
These powers are positively granted in the charter over your own signature; and now, dear sir, where can be the justice in depriving us of these rights which are lawfully ours, as well as they are the lawful rights of the inhabitants of Quincy and Springfield and many other places where the citizens enjoy the advantages of such ordinances, without controversy.420 With these considerations, and many more which might be adduced, give us the privilege and we will show your Honor, and the world besides, if required, that the Mr Smith referr’d to in the demand from Missouri, is not the Joseph Smith of Nauvoo, for he was not in Missouri; neither is he [p. 187]
described in the writ, according as the Law requires; and that he is not a fugitive from justice.421 Why then, be so strenuos to have my husband taken, when you know him to be innocent of an attempt on the life of Governor [Lilburn W.] Boggs, and that he is not a fugitive from justice? It is not the fear of a just decision against him, that deters Mr Smith from going into Missouri; but it is an actual knowledge that it was never intended he should have a fair trial. And now Sir, if you were not aware of the fact; I will acquaint you with it now, that there were lying <​in​> wait, between this place and Warsaw, twelve men from Jackson County, Missouri, for the purpose of taking Mr Smith out of the hands of the officers who might have him in custody. Also those two men from Missouri that were here with Messrs [Thomas] King and [James] Pitman, divulg’d the most illegal and infernal calculations concerning taking Mr Smith into Missouri the evidence of which, we can furnish you at any time, if required. And dear Sir, our good feelings revolt at the suggestion that your Excellency is acquainted with the unlawful measures taken by those engaged in the prosecution— measures which, if justice was done to others, as it would be done to us, were we to commit as great errors in our proceedings, would subject all concerned in the prosecution to the penalty of the law, and that without mercy.
I admit Sir— that it is next to an impossibility, for any one to know the extent of the tyranny, treachery, and knavery of a great portion of the leading characters of the State of Missouri: yet it only requires a knowledge of the constitution of the United States, and Statute of the State of Missouri; and a knowledge of the outrages committed by some of the inhabitants of that State upon the people called Mormons, and that pass’d unpunished by the administrators of the law; to know that there is not the least confidence to be placed in any of those men that were engaged in those disgraceful transactions.
If the law was made for the lawless and disobedient, and punishment instituted for the guilty, why not execute the law upon those that have transgressed it, and punish those who have committed crime, and grant encouragement to the innocent, and liberality to the industrious & peaceable. And now I entreat your honor to bear with me patiently while I ask, what good can accrue to this state or the United States, or any part of this State or the United States, or to yourself, or any other individual, to continue this persecution upon this people, or upon Mr Smith— a persecution that you are well aware, is entirely without any just foundation or excuse. With sentiments of due respect I am your most obedient servant
Emma Smith
To His Excellency Thomas Carlin
Governor of the State of Illinois.
P.S. Sir. You will please tender my best respects and considerations to your wife and family, and tell them I greatly desire to see them with yourself in our place as soon as can be convenient. Emma Smith.[”] [p. 188]
 4 September 1842 • Sunday
Sunday 4th. This day President Hyrum Smith & president Wm. Law started for the East accompanied by brothers [Erastus] Derby & [Edwin] Woolley.422 President Joseph sent the following letter to W[illiam] Clayton by brother Erastus H. Derby. The president wrote it and requested it to be read before the saints when assembled at the Grove near the Temple for preaching which was done according to his request.
423“September 1st. 1842
“To all the saints in Nauvoo.—
Forasmuch as the Lord has revealed unto me that my enemies, both of Missouri and this State were again on the pursuit of me; and inasmuch as they pursue me without cause, and have not the least shadow, or coloring of justice, or right on their side, in the getting up of their prosecutions against me; and inasmuch as their pretensions are all founded in falsehood of the blackest die; I have thought it expedient and wisdom in me to leave the place for a short season, for my own safety and the safety of this people. I would say to all those with whom I have business, that I have left my affairs with agents and Clerks, who will transact all business in a prompt and proper manner; and will see that all my debts are cancell’d in due time, by turning out property or otherwise as the case may require, or as the circumstances may admit of. When I learn that the storm is fully blown over, then, I will return to you again: and as for the perils which I am call’d to pass through; they seem but a small thing to me, as the fury and wrath of man have been my common lot all the days of my life; and for what cause, it seems mysterious, unless I was ordained from before the foundation of the world, for some good end, or bad, as you may choose to call it: Judge ye for yourselves, God knoweth all these things whether it be good or bad; but nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim in; it all has become a second nature to me and I feel like Paul, to glory in tribulation,424 for unto this day, has the God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from henceforth; for behold and lo! I shall triumph over all my enemies, for the Lord God hath spoken it.
Let all the saints rejoice therefore and be exceeding glad, for Israel’s God is their God and he will meet out a just recompence of reward upon the heads of all your oppressors. And again, verily, thus saith the Lord, let the work of my Temple, and all the works which I have appointed unto you, be continued on and not cease; and let your diligence and your perseverence, and patience and your works be redoubled, and you shall in no wise lose your reward saith the Lord of Hosts. And if they persecute you, so persecuted they the prophets and righteous men that were before you: for all this, there is a reward in heaven.425
And again, I give unto [you]426 a word in relation to the baptism for your dead. Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning your dead;427 Let there be a Recorder, and let him be eye-witness of your baptisms; let him hear with his ears that he may testify of a truth saith the Lord; that in all your recordings, it may be recorded in heaven; <​that​> whatsoever you loose <​bind​> on earth may be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth may be loosed in heaven;428 for I am about to restore many things to the earth pertaining [p. 189]
to the Priesthood saith the Lord of Hosts. And again, let all the Records be had in order, that they may be put in the archives of my holy Temple, to be held in remembrance from generation to generation, saith the Lord of Hosts.
I will say to all the saints, that I desired with exceeding great desire, to have address’d them from the Stand, on the subject of baptism for the dead, on the following sabbath: But inasmuch as it is out of my power to do so, I will write the Word of the Lord from time to time, on that subject, and send it you by Mail, as well as many other things.
I now close my letter for the present, for the want of more time; for the enemy is on the alert, and as the Savior said, the prince of this world cometh, but he hath nothing in me.429 Behold! my prayer to God, is, that you all may be saved and I subscribe myself, your servant in the Lord, prophet and Seer of the Church of Jesus Christ, of Latter-Day Saints.
Joseph Smith.[”]
When this letter was read before the brethren it cheered their hearts and evidently had the effect of stimulating them and inspiring them with courage, and faithfulness.
 6 September 1842 • Tuesday
Tuesday 6th. This evining W. C. [William Clayton], Newel K. Whitney, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball & Amasa Lyman visited President Joseph, the three latter especially to council concerning their mission &c430 and the two former concerning a settlement with brother Edward Hunter. The evening was spent cheerfully but nothing of special importance transpired.
 7 September 1842 • Wednesday
Wednesday 7th. Early this morning Elder [George J.] Adams and brother [David] Rogers from New York visited president Joseph and brought several letters from some of the brethren in that region. One letter from Dr. Willard Richards431 I will mention in this place. When speaking concerning his interview with Mr James Arlington Bennett [Bennet] Esqr of New York he says. “He would be happy to receive a letter of his (president Josephs) own dictation, signed by his own hand”.
General J. A. Bennett had wrote a letter and sent it by mail which was received a few days ago, and when president Joseph read the foregoing clause in Dr Richards letter he concluded to write him an answer. I will now record the letter from Genl Jas Arlington Bennett which is as follows—
432“Arlington House August 16th. 1842
“Dear Sir—
Your polite and friendly note was handed to me a few days since by Dr W[illard] Richards,433 who I must say is a very fine specimen of the Mormon people if they are all like him, and indeed I think him a very excellent representative of yourself, as I find he is your most devoted admirer and true disciple. He spent two days with me, and from his arguments and extremely mild and gentlemanly demeaner almost made me a Mormon.
You have another representative here, (who spent a day with me some time since) of the name of [Lucian] Foster, who is I think president of the church in New York and most unquestionably a most excellent and good man, [p. 190]
and would be so if he were Turk, Jew or Saint. He is Ab initio a good man and to you a most true, enthusiastic and devoted disciple. He has no guile. Dr [John] Bernhisel of New York too, is a most excellent man and true christian. These are men with whom I could associate forever, even if I never joined their church or acknowledged their faith.
General John C. Bennett called on me last friday and spent just two hours when he left as he said for the Eastern States. Being aware that Elder Richards was here he had very little to say. He however proposed to me to aid him, wether serious or not, in arranging materials for publishing “an exposition of Mormon Secrets and practices”— which I peremptorily refused on two grounds. 1st. That I had nothing to do with any quarrel that might arise between you and him, as I could not be a judge of the merits or demerits of the matter and 2ndly that inasmuch as he himself had proposed to you and your council to confer on me honors which I never sought, yet which I highly prize,434 it would be the height of ingratitude as well as inconsistent with every principle of common honesty and propriety, for me to join him in an effort to lower my own honors by attempting to lower in public estimation the people from whom those honors emanated. He gave [James Gordon] Bennett of the Herald his commission which I opposed from the very first, and you now see by that paper the sport which that man has made of it.435 I tell you there is no dependance on the friendship of that Editor when his interest is at issue. I am assured that J. G. B. [James Gordon Bennett] is going to publish conjointly with J. C. B. [John C. Bennett] on half profit, the exposition against you and your people, which is going to contain a great number of scandalous cuts and plates. But dont be concerned, you will receive no injury whatever from any thing that any man or set of men may say against you. The whole of this muss is only extending your fame and will increase your numbers ten fold. You have nothing to expect from that part of community who are bigotedly attached to the other churches. They have always believed, and still believe every thing said to your disadvantage; and what General J. C. Bennett is now saying in the papers is nothing more than what was common report before, throughout this whole community, insomuch that I had to contradict it in the Herald under the signature of “Cincinatus”,436 and even requested the Elders at the Mormon Church to do so long ago. You therefore have lost not a whit of ground by it. I must in charity forbear commenting on the course of Genl Bennett in this matter— considering all things, delicacy forbids such a course. There are some things however, I feel very sorely and could wish they had not transpired He and the Herald will make money out of the Book and then the matter will end, as you will find that the Herald will puff it to the skies.437 The books which I sent you, you will retain in your hands for the present. My respects to your amiable lady and all friends and believe me as ever, tho, not a Mormon, your sincere friend—
James Arlington Bennett [Bennet] [p. 191]
P.S. I know of no reason why the Wasp was not continued to be sent to me. I dont like the name. Mildness should characterise every thing that comes from Nauvoo and even a name as Paley says in his Ethics438 has much influence on one side or the other. My respects to your brother its Editor.439 I would just say that Gen. J. C. Bennett, appeared to me to be in very low spirits. And I find that many communications intended for you from me, has never reached you. Those Books were made over to J C. B. on the presumption that he would in his own name present them for the benifit of the Temple440
J. A. B.”
In consequence of president Joseph not having the foregoing with him he concluded to write his answer tomorrow. He however wrote—or rather dictated a long Epistle to the Saints which he ordered to be read next Sabbath and which will be recorded under that date.441
In the P.M. brothers Adams & Rogers came to visit him again. They conversed upon the present persecution &c president Joseph in his discourse to brothers Adams and Rogers shewed the many great interpositions of the Almighty in his behalf not only during the present trouble, but more especially during the persecution in Missouri &c. The remarks drop[p]ed on this occasion was truly encouraging and calculated to increase the confidence of those present.
 8 September 1842 • Thursday
Thursday 8th. This A.M president Joseph dictated the following letter to Gen. James Arlington Bennett [Bennet] as before stated— The letter is as follows.—
442“Nauvoo September 8th. 1842
Dear Sir—
I have just received your very consoling letter dated August 16th. 1842; which I think, is the first letter you ever addressed to me; in which you speak of the arrival of Dr. W[illard] Richards, and of his person very respectfully. In this I rejoice; for I am as warm a friend to Dr. Richards as he possibly can be to me: And in relation to his almost making a Mormon of yourself, it puts me in mind of the saying of Paul in his reply to Agrippa, Acts ch. 26th v. 29th, “I would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day; were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.” And I will here remark, my dear Sir; that Mormonism is the pure doctrine of Jesus Christ; of which I myself, am not asham’d.443
You speak also of Elder [Lucian] Foster, President of the Church in New-York, in high terms: and of Dr. [John] Bernhisel of New-York. These men I am acquainted with by information; and it warms my heart, to know that you speak well of them; and as you say, could be willing to associate with them forever, if you never joined their church, or acknowledged their faith. This is a good principle; for when we see virtuous qualities in men, we should always acknowledge them, let their understanding be what it may in relation to creeds and doctrine; for all men are, or ought to be free; possessing unalienable rights, and the high, and noble qualifications of the laws of nature and of self-preservation; to think, and act, and say as they please; while they maintain a due respect to the rights and privileges of all other creatures; infringing upon none. This [p. 192]
doctrine I do most heartily subscribe to, and practice; the testimony of mean men, to the contrary, notwithstanding. But Sir, I will assure you, that my soul soars far above all the mean and grovelling dispositions of men that are dispos’d to abuse me and my character; I therefore shall not dwell upon that subject.
In relation to those men you speak of, referred to above; I will only say that there are thousands of such men in this church; who, if a man is found worthy to associate with, will call down the envy of a mean world, because of their high and noble demeanor; and it is with unspeakable delight that I contemplate them as my friends & brethren. I love them with a perfect love; and I hope they love me, and have no reason to doubt but they do.
The next in consideration is John C. Bennett. I was his friend. I am yet his friend; as I feel myself bound to be a friend to all the sons of Adam; whether they are just or unjust, they have a degree of my compassion & sympathy. If he is my enemy it is his own fault; and the responsibility rests upon his own head; and instead of arraigning444 his character before you, suffice it to say, that his own conduct wherever he goes, will be sufficient to recommend him to an enlightened public, whether for a bad man, or a good one. Therefore whosoever will associate themselves with him, may be assured that I will not persecute them; but I do not wish their association: And what I have said may suffice on that subject, so far as his character is concern’d.
Now in relation to his book that he may write, I will venture a prophecy; that whosoever has any hand in the matter, will find themselves in a poor fix, in relation to the money matters. And as to my having any fears of the influence that he may have against me; or any other man or set of men may have, is the most foreign from my heart; for I never knew what it was, as yet, to fear the face of clay, or the influence of man. My fear, Sir, is before God. I fear to offend him, and strive to keep his commandments. I am really glad that you did not join John C. in relation to his book, from the assurances which I have, that it will prove a curse to all those who touch it.
In relation to the honors that you speak of, both for yourself and James Gordon Bennett of the Herald,445 you are both strangers to me, and as John C. Bennett kept all his letters, which he receiv’d from you, entirely to himself; and there was no correspondence between you and me, that I knew of; I had no opportunity to share very largely in in the getting up of any of those matters. I could not, as I had not sufficient knowledge to enable me to do so. The whole, therefore, was at the instigation of John C. Bennett, and a quiet submission on the part of the rest, out of the best of feelings.
But as for myself, it was all done at a time when I was overwhelm’d with a great many business cares, as well as the care of all the churches. I must be excus’d therefore, for any wrongs that may have taken place, in relation to this matter: And so far as I [p. 193]
obtain a knowledge of that which is right shall meet with my hearty approval.
I feel to tender you my most hearty and sincere thanks, for every expression of kindness, you have tendered towards me or my brethren; and would beg the privilege of obtruding myself a little while upon your patience, in offering a short relation of my circumstances. I am at this time persecuted the worst of any man on <​the​> earth; as well as this people, here in this place; and all our sacred rights are trampled under the feet of the mob.
I am now hunted as an hart, by the mob, under the pretence or shadow of law, to cover their abominable deeds. An unhallowed demand has been made from the Governor of Missouri, on oath of Governor [Lilburn W.] Boggs; that I made an attempt to assassinate him on the night of the sixth of May; when on that day, I was attending the officer Drill, and answered to my name when the roll was call’d: and on the seventh, it is well known by the thousands that assembled here in Nauvoo, that I was at my post in reviewing the Nauvoo Legion in the presence of twelve thousand people: And the Governor of the State of Illinois, notwithstanding his being knowing to all these facts, yet he immediately granted a Writ; and by an unhallowed usurpation, has taken away our chartered rights, and denied the right of Habeas Corpus; and has now about thirty of the446 blood-thirsty kind of men447 in this place, in search for me; threatening death and destruction, and extermination upon all the Mormons; and searching my house almost continually from day to day; menacing and threat’ning, and intimidating an innocent wife and children, & insulting them in a most diabolical manner; threatening their lives &c. if I am not to be found, with a gang of Missourians with them; saying they will have me dead or alive; and if alive, they will carry me to Missouri in chains, and when there, they will kill me at all hazards. And all this, is backed up, and urged on, by the Governor of this State, with all the rage of a demon; putting at defiance, the Constitution of this State—our chartered rights—and the Constitution of the United States: For not as yet, have they done one thing that was in accordance to them.
While all the citizens of this city, en mass, have petitioned the Governor with remonstrances, and overtures, that would have melted the heart of an adamantine, to no effect.448 And at the same time, if any of us open our mouths, to plead our own cause; in the defiance449 of law and justice, we are instantly threatened with Militia and extermination. Great God! When shall the oppressor cease to prey and glut itself upon innocent blood! Where is Patriotism? Where is Liberty? Where is the boast of this proud and haughty nation? O humanity! where hast thou fled? Hast thou fled forever?
I now appeal to you Sir, inasmuch as you have subscribed yourself our friend; will you lift your voice and your arm, with indignation against such unhallowed oppression? I must say, Sir that my bosom swells with unutterable anguish, when I contemplate the scenes of horror that we have passed through in the State of Missouri; and then look, and behold and see the storm and cloud [p. 194]
gathering ten times blacker; ready to burst upon the heads of this innocent people! Would to God that I were able to throw off the yoke. Shall we bow down and be slaves? Are there no friends of humanity, in a nation that boasts itself so much? Will not the nation rise up and defend us? If they will not defend us, will they not grant to lend a voice of indignation, against such unhallowed oppression? Must the tens of thousands bow down to slavery and degradation? Let the pride of the nation arise and wrench these shackles from the feet of their fellow citizens, and their quiet, and peaceable, and innocent and loyal subjects. But I must forbear, for I cannot express my feelings. The Legion would all willingly die in the defence of their rights; but what would this accomplish? I have kept down their indignation and kept a quiet submission on all hands; and am determined to do so at all hazards. Our enemies shall not have it to say, that we rebel against government, or commit treason; however much they may lift their hands in oppression and tyranny, when it comes in the form of government— we tamely submit altho’ it lead us to the slaughter, and to beggary: but our blood be upon their garments: And those who look tamely on and boast of patriotism, shall not be without their condemnation. And if men are such fools, as to let once the precedent be established, and through their prejudices, give assent to such abominations; then let the oppressor’s hand lay heavily throughout the world, until all flesh shall feel it together; and until they may know that the Almighty takes cognizance of such things. And then shall church rise up against church; and party against party; mob, against mob; oppressor against oppressor; army against army; and kingdom against kingdom; and people against people; and kindred against kindred. And where, Sir, will be your safety, or the safety of your children; if my children can be led to the slaughter with impunity by the hands of murderous rebels? Will they not lead yours to the slaughter, with the same impunity? Ought not then, this oppression Sir, to be check’d in the bud; and to be looked down with just indignation by an enlightened world, before the flame become unextinguishable, and the fire devour the stubble?
But again I say I must forbear, and leave this painful subject. I wish you would write to me in answer to this, and let me know your views.450 On my part, I am ready to be offered up a sacrifice, in that way that can bring to pass the greatest benefit and good, to those who must necessarily be interested in this important matter.451 I would to God, that you could know all my feelings on this subject, and the real facts in relation to this people, and their unrelenting persecution: And if any man feels an interest in the welfare of their fellow-beings; and would think of saying or doing anything in this matter; I would suggest the propriety of a committee of wise men, being sent to ascertain the justice or injustice of our cause—to get in possession of all the facts; and then make report to an enlightened world, whether [p. 195]
whether we individually, or collectively, are destroying <​deserving​> such high-handed treatment.
In relation to the books that you sent here, John C. Bennett put them into my Store, to be sold on commission; saying, that when I was able, the money must be remitted to yourself. Nothing was said about my452 consecration to the Temple.453
Another calamity has befallen us. Our Post Office in this place, is exceedingly corrupt. It is with great difficulty that we can get our letters to, or from our friends.454 Our papers that we send to our subscribers, are embezzled and burned, or wasted. We get no money from our subscribers, and very little information from abroad; and what little we do get, we get by private means, in consequence of these things: and I am sorry to say, that this robbing of the Post Office of money, was carried on by John C. Bennett; and since he left here, it is carried on by the means of his confederates.455
I now subscribe myself your friend, and a patriot and lover of my country, pleading at their feet for protection and deliverance, by the justice of their Constitutions.
I add no more.456
Your most obedient servant,
Joseph Smith.[”]

Friday 9th. This P.M. after dark president Joseph received a very pleasant visit from Sister Emma, Wilson Law, Amasa Lyman & George A. Smith.
 10 September 1842 • Saturday
Saturday 10th. This being the Training day457 for the companies composing the Legion president Joseph kept very close and still; lest on account of the quantity of people passing two and fro he should accidently be discovered. After dark sister Emma sent word by a Messinger that she wished him to come home, as she thought he would be as safe at home as any where for the present. Brother Wilson Law also went and carried the same report; consequently the president left for home where he arrived safe and undiscovered.——

Sunday 11th. At home all day— At president Josephs request the following letter which himself dictated which [was?] read to the saints at the Grove near the Temple.
458Journeying, Septr. 6th 1842.459
To the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints;— Sendeth Greeting.
As I stated to you in my letter before I left my place,460 that I would write to you from time to time, and give you information in relation to many subjects: I now resume the subject of the baptism for the dead as that subject seems to occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest, since I have been pursued by my enemies, I wrote a few words of Revelation to you concerning a Recorder. I have had a few additional views in relation to this matter, which I now certify; ie. It was declared in my former letter that there [p. 196]
should be a Recorder who should be eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears that he might make a Record of a truth before the Lord. Now, in relation to this matter; it would be very difficult for one Recorder to be present at all times and to do all the business. To obviate this difficulty, there can be a Recorder appointed in each ward of the City,461 who is well qualified for taking accurate minutes; and let him be very particular and precise in making his Record and taking the whole proceeding; certifying in his Record, that he saw with his eyes, and heard with his ears; giving the date, and names &c. and the history of the whole transaction, naming also some three individuals that are present, if there be any present who can at any time, when call’d upon, certify to the same; that in the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established.462 Then let there be a general Recorder463 to whom these other Records can be handed, being attended with certifi-cates over their own signatures; certifying that the Record which they have made, is true. Then the General Church Recorder can enter the Record on the general Church Book with the Certificates and all the attending witnesses, with his own statement that he verily believes the above statements and Records to be true, from his knowledge of the general character and appointment of those men by the Church. And when this is done on the general Church Book; the Record shall be just as holy, and shall answer the ordinance just the same as if he had seen with his eyes and heard with his ears, and made a Record of the same on the general Book.
You may think this Order of things to be very particular: But let me tell you, that they are only to answer the will of God by conforming to the ordinance and preparation, that the Lord ordained and prepared before the foundation of the world for the salvation of the dead who should die without a knowledge of the Gospel. And further, I want you to remember that John, the Revelator was contemplating this very subject in relation to the dead, when he declar’d, as you will find recorded in Revelations Chap. 20th v. 12; And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God: and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of Life; and the dead were judg’d out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. You will discover in this quotation, that the books were opened, and another book was opened which is the book of life; but the dead were judg’d out of those things which were written in the books according to their works; consequently, the books spoken of, must be the books which contained the record of their works, and refers to the Records which are kept on the earth: And the book which was the book of Life, is the Record which is kept in heaven; the principle agreeing precisely with the doctrine which is commanded you in the Revelation contained in the letter which I wrote you previous to my leaving my place, “that in all your recordings it may be recorded in heaven”.464 Now the nature of this ordinance consists in the power of the Priesthood by the revelations of Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever [p. 197]
you bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven:465 Or in other words, taking a different view of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in heaven; and whatsoever you do not record on earth, shall not be recorded in heaven; for out of the books, shall your dead be judg’d according to their works, whether they, themselves have attended to the ordinances in their own propria persona, or by the means of their own agents according to the ordinance which God has prepared for their salvation, from before the foundation of the world, according to the records which they have kept concerning their dead. It may seem to some, to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of; a power which records, or binds on earth, and binds in heaven. Nevertheless, in all ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the Priesthood to any man, by actual revelation, or any set of men; this power has always been given: Hence, whatsoever those men did in authority, in the name of the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven; and could not be annull’d according to the decree of the great Jehovah. This is a faithful saying: Who can hear it? And again for a precedent, Matt. chapter 16 verses 18, 19, “And I say also unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee, the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.[”] Now the great and grand secret of the whole matter, and the sum and bonum [summum bonum] of the whole subject that is lying before us consists in obtaining the powers of the Holy Priesthood. For him, to whom these keys are given; there is no difficulty in obtaining a knowledge of facts in relation to the salvation of men the children of men; both as well for the dead as for the living. Herein is glory, and honor, and immortality and eternal life. The ordinance of baptism by water, to be immers’d therein in order to answer to the likeness of the dead, that one principle might accord with the other to be immers’d in the water, and come forth out of the water is in the likeness of the resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of their graves: hence, this ordinance was instituted to form a relationship with the ordinance of baptism for the dead; being in likeness of the dead. Consequently, the baptismal Font was instituted as a simile of the grave, and was commanded to be in a place underneath where the living are wont to assemble, to show forth the living and the dead; and that all things may have their likeness, and that they may accord one with another; that which is earthly, conforming to that which is heavenly, as Paul hath declar’d 1st Corinthians, Chap. 15, verses 46, 47 & 48. “Howbeit, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward, that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man, is the Lord from heaven. [p. 198]
As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly:[”] And as are the records on the earth in relation to your dead, which are truly made out; so also are the records in heaven. This, therefore, is the sealing and binding power; and in one sense of the word the keys of the kingdom, which consists in the key of knowledge.
And now my dearly and beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure me466 that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living; that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation; for their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation; as Paul says concerning the fathers, “That they without us, cannot be made perfect”;467 neither can we without our dead, be made perfect. And now, in relation to the baptism for the dead; I will give you another quotation of Paul, 1 Cor. 15 chap. verse 29 “Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?” And again in connexion with this quotation I will give you a quotation from one of the prophets, which had his eye fix’d on the restoration of the Priesthood— the glories to be reveal’d in the last days, and in an especial manner, this most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlasting Gospel, viz. the baptism for the dead; for Malachi says, last chap.— verses 5 & 6. “Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and terrible dreadful day of the Lord; And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse”. I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my purpose, as it stands, It is sufficient to know in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse, unless there is a welding link of some kind or other, between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other. And behold! what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them, cannot be made perfect; neither can they, without us, be made perfect. Neither can they or us, be made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times; which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole, and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations and keys, and powers and glories should take place, and be reveal’d, from the days of Adam even to the present time; and not only this, but those things that never have been reveal’d from the foundation of the world; but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent; shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings, in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.
Now what do we hear in the Gospel which we have received? A voice of gladness— a voice of mercy from heaven— a voice of truth out of the earth— glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the living and and the dead; glad tidings of great joy! How beautiful upon the mountains, are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things; and that say unto Zion, behold! thy God reigneth.468 As the dews of Carmel so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them. And again, [p. 199]
What do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah! Moroni, an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfilment of the prophets— the book to be reveal’d! A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca County, declaring the three witnesses to bear record of the Book, The voice of Michael on the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the devil when he appeared as an angel of light. The voice of Peter, James & John, in the wilderness, between Harmony, Susquehanna County, and Colesville, Broom County, on the Susquehanna river; declaring themselves as having possessing the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times, And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old father Whitmer [Peter Whitmer Sr.] in Fayette, Seneca County, and at sundry times, and in divers places, through all the travels and tribulations, of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. And the voice of Michael the archangel— the voice of Gabriel, and of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael or Adam, down to the present time; all declaring, each one their dispensation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty & glory, and the power of their Priesthood; giving line upon line; precept upon precept; here a little and there a little: giving us consolation by holding forth that which is to come and confirming our hope.
Brethren, shall we not go on in so good <​great​> a cause? Go forward and not go backward. Courage, brethren! and on to the victory. Let your hearts rejoice and be exceeding glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the king Immanuel, who hath ordain’d before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prisons; for the prisoner shall go free. Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye vallies, cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your eternal king: And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord: and ye solid rocks, leap for joy.469 And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing470 together; and let all the sons of God, shout for joy: And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever.
And again, I say, how glorious is the voice we hear from heaven proclaiming in our ears, glory and salvation, and honor, and immortality and eternal life. Kingdoms, principals principalities and powers! behold! the great day of the Lord is at hand, and who can abide the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fuller’s soap: and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.471 And let us,472 present in his holy Temple, when it is finished, a Book, containing the Records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation.
Brethren, I have many things to say to you on the subject; but shall now close for the present, and continue the subject another time.473 [p. 200]
I am as ever your humble servant, and never deviating friend,
Joseph Smith.
The important instructions contained in the foregoing letter made a deep and solemn impression on the minds of the saints, and they manifested their intentions to obey the instructions to the letter.474
 12 September 1842 • Monday
Monday 12th. At home all day in company with brothers [George J.] Adams & [David] Rogers, and councilling brother Adams to write a letter to the Governor. In the P.M sister Emma received a letter from the Governor the following of which is a copy.
“Quincy September 7th. 1842
Dear Madam—
Your letter of the 27th. Ultimo475 was delivered to me on Monday the 5th. instant, and I have not had time to answer it untill this evening, and I now appropriate a few moments to the difficult task of replying satisfactorily to its contents, every word of which evinces your devotedness to the interest of your husband and pouring forth the effusions of a heart wholly his. I am thus admonished that I can say nothing, that does not subserve his interest that can possibly be satisfactory to you. and before I proceed I will here repeat, my great regret that I have been officially called upon to act in reference to Mr Smith in any manner whatever. I doubt not your candor when you say you do not desire me “to swerve from my duty as executive in the least” and all you ask is to be allowed the privileges, and advantages guaranteed to you by the constitution and laws. You then refer me to the 11th. Section of the Charter of the City of Nauvoo, and claim for Mr Smith the right to be heard by the Municipal Court of said city, under a writ of Habeus Corpus emanating from said court— when he was held in custody under an executive warrant. The charter of the City of Nauvoo is not before me at this time, but I have examined both the charters, and city ordinance476 upon the subject, and must express my surprise at the extraordinary assumption of power by the board of Aldermen as contained in said ordinance! from my recollection of the charter it authorizes the Municipal Court to issue writs of Habeues Corpus in all cases of imprisonment, or custody, arising from the authority of the ordinances of said city, but that the power was granted, or intended to be granted to release persons held in custody under the authority of writs issued by the courts, or the executive of the State, is most absurd & rediculous, and an attempt to exercise it, is a gross usurpation of power, that cannot be tolerated. I have always expected, and desired; that Mr Smith should avail himself of the benefits of the laws of this State, and of course that he would be entitled to a writ of Habeus Corpus issued by the circuit court, and entitled to a hearing before said court, but to claim the right of a hearing before the Municipal court of the city of Nauvoo is a burlesque upon the charter itself. As to Mr Smiths guilt, or innocence of the crime [p. 201]
charged upon him, it is not my province to investigate or determine, nor has any court on earth jurisdiction of his case, but the courts of the State of Missouri, and as stated in my former letter both the constitution and laws presumes that each and every State in this Union, are competant to do justice to all who may be charged with crime committed in said State. Your information that twelve men from Jackson County Mo. were lying in wait for Mr Smith between Nauvoo and Warsaw, for the purpose of taking him out of the hands of the officers who might have him in custody, and murdering him, is like many other marvellous stories that you hear in reference to him— not one word of it true, but I doubt not that your mind has been continually harrowed up with fears produced by that, and other equally groundless stories— that that statement is true is next to impossible, and your own judgement if you will but give it scope will soon set you right in reference to it— if any of the citizens of Jackson had designed to murder Mr Smith, they would not have been so simple as to perpetrate the crime in Illinois, when he would necessarily be required to pass through to the interior of the State of Missouri, where the opportunity would have been so much better, and the prospect of escape much more certain— that is like the statement made by Mr Smiths first messenger after his arrest, to Messrs [James] Ralston and [Calvin A.] Warren— saying that I had stated that Mr Smith should be surrendered to the authorities of Mo. dead or alive— not one word of which was true. I have not the most distant thought that any person in Illinois, or Missouri, contemplated personal injury to Mr Smith by violence in any manner whatever.
I regret that I did not see Genl [Wilson] Law when last at Quincy. A previous engagement upon business that could not be dispensed with prevented and occupied my attention that evening untill dark. At half past 1 o clock P.M. I came home and learned that the Genl had called to see me, but the hurry of business only allowed me about ten minutes time to eat my dinner and presuming if he had business of any importance that he would remain in the city untill I returned. It may be proper here in order to afford you all the satisfaction in my power, to reply to a question propounded to my wife by Genl. Law in referrence to Mr Smith viz. wether any other, or additional demand had been made upon me by the Govr of Mo. for the surrender of Mr Smith— I answer none, no change whatever has been made in the proceedings. Mr Smith is held accountable only, for the charge as set forth in my warrant under which he was arrested. In conclusion you presume upon my own knowledge of Mr Smiths innocence— and ask why the prosecution is continued against him. Here I must again appeal to your own good judgement and you will be compelled to answer that it is impossible I could know him to be innocent— and as before stated it is not my province to investigate as to his guilt or innocence, but could I know him innocent, and were he my own son, I would nevertheless— (and the more readily) surrender him to the legally constituted authority [p. 202]
to pronounce him innocent.
With sentiments of high regard and esteem
Your Obt. servant
Tho Carlin”

Wednesday 14th. At home. Mr [Jacob] Remick of Keokuk gave president Joseph a Deed for one half of the Land and property he owned in Keokuk amounting to many thousand dollars.478 Had consultation with C[alvin] A. Warren Esqr— In the P.M. received the following letter from Genl. J. Arlington Bennett [James Arlington Bennet]
479“Arlington House Sepr 1— 1842
Lieut. Gen. Smith
Dr Sir,— Mrs Smiths letter to Mrs Bennett480 containing a very lucid account of Dr John C. Bennett has been received and the only thing concerning him that I regard of importance, is, that you found it necessary to expose him. I wish most ardently that you had let him depart in peace, because the public generally think no better of either the one party or the other in consequence of the pretended exposures with which the newspapers have teemed.481 But then on the long run you will have the advantage, inasmuch as the universal notoriety which you are now acquiring will be the means of adding to Nauvoo three hundred fold.
That you ought to be given up to the tender mercies of Missouri no man in his senses will allow, as you would be convicted on the shadow of evidence when the peoples passions and prejudices are so strongly enlisted against you and under such a state of things how easy it would be to subern [suborn] witnesses against you who would seal your fate. Add to this, too, the great difficulty under which an impartial Jury, if such could be found, would labor in their attempt to render an honest verdict, being cohersed by surrounding public prejudice and malice. And yet as you are now circumstanced it will not do to oppose force to force, for your protection, as this in the present case would be treason against the State and would ultimately bring to ruin all those concerned.
Your only plan I think will be to keep out of the way until this excitement shall have subsided, as from all I can understand even from the Dr himself, there is no evidence on which an honest jury could find against you and this opinion I have expressed to him. I most ardently wish that you had one hundred thousand true men at Nauvoo and that I had the command of them— Times and things would soon alter. I hope to see the day before I die that such an army will dictate times from Nauvoo to the enemies of the Mormon people. I say this in the most perfect candor <​as​> I have nothing to gain by the Mormons, nor am I a Mormon in creed, yet I regard them in as favorable alight, (and a little more so) as I do any other sect. In fact I am a Philosophical Christian [p. 203]
and wish to see an entire change in the religious world.
I have been long a Mormon in sympathy alone and probably can never be one in any other way,482 yet I feel that I am the friend of the people as I think them honest and sincere in their faith and these I know as good and honorable men as any other professing Christians.
Dr. Bennett has been the means of bringing me before your people, you will therefore see for this act I am in honor bound to say “Peace to his Manes.”483 To act otherwise would be ungrateful and dishonorable, both of which qualities are strangers to my nature. Nevertheless by leaving him as he is I can still be your friend, for be assured that nothing I have yet seen from his pen has in the least altered my opinion of you. I will well know what allowance to make in such cases.
Docter Bennett and [Origen] Bachelor are now delivering lectures in New York against you and your doctrines and asserted practises at Nauvoo.484 Elder [Lucian] Foster told me this forenoon that the seats have been torn to pieces out of his church in Canal St, and that the congregation had to move to another place. I intimated to you in my last485 that [James Gordon] Bennett of the Herald was about to publish conjointly with the Dr his Book of Exposures but since have learned that it is about to come out in Boston.486 He expects to make a fortune out of it, and I presume he needs it, but I feel sure that it will only make converts to the Mormon faith. He has borrowed largely from Com. Morris’ lacivious Poems.487
A general Order signed by Hugh Mc Fall; Agt. [Adjutant] General and authorised by you has appeared in the Herald,488 ordering me to repair to Nauvoo to take command of the Legion, and to bring with me Brig. Gen. J. G. Bennett, which states that if the requisition489 be persisted in blood must be shed. I have assured Bennett of the Herald that I deem it a hoax but he insists upon it that it is genuine. My reply to it has appeared to day in that paper.490 I have there stated that I have written to Govr. [Thomas] Carlin for instructions, this is not so, it is only a rub.491 On the whole you will only be made a greater Prophet and a greater man a great492 Emperor by the affliction493 and consideration of your good friends. My respects with those of Mrs B. to your lady
I am Dr Sir your sincere friend.
James Arlington Bennett [Bennet][This is a broken underline.].[”]
This letter was placed in the hands of Genl Hugh Mc Fall who immediately wrote a refutation of the clause concerning himself to Governor [Thomas] Carlin, and also one for the Wasp.494 The general order was not wrote by Mc Fall neither had he a knowledge of its existence untill shown to him in the letter. It is evidently got up by our enemies to increase excitement and anger, and is barely another addition to the many slanderous reports put in circulation by evil and designing men. [p. 204]

 30 September 1842 • Friday

 1 October 1842 • Saturday
October Saturday 1st. This A.M. President Joseph is sick, having a very severe pain in his left side; was not able to be about in consequence. Sister Emma about as usual. The President had previously sent for the Temple Committee to balance their accounts and ascertain how the Temple business was going on. Some reports had been circulated that the committee was not making a righteous disposition of property consecrated for the building of the Temple and there appeared to be some disatisfaction amongst the laborers. After carefully examining the accounts and enquiring into the manner of the proceedings of Committee President Joseph expressed himself perfectly satisfied with them and their works. The books were [p. 205] ballanced between the Trustee501 and Committee and the wages of all agreed upon.502 The president remarked that he was amenable to the state for the faithful discharge of his duties as Trustee in Trust and that the Temple Committee were accontable to him and to no other authority;503 and they must not take notice of any complaints from any source but let the complaints be made to him if any were needed and he would make things right. The parties separated perfectly satisfied and the president said he would have a notice published stating that he had examined their accounts and was satisfied &c.—504 It was also agreed that the Recorders Office should be moved to the Temple, for better convenience.—505
 2 October 1842 • Sunday
Sunday 2nd. About 1 o clock A.M. a messenger arrived from Quincey stating that the Governor506 had offered a reward of $200 for President Joseph and also $200 for O. P. [Orrin Porter] Rockwell. This report was fully established on receipt of the Mail papers. The Quincy Whig also stated that Governor [Thomas] Reynolds had offered a reward; and published the Governors proclamation offerring a reward of $300 for President Joseph and $300 for O. P. Rockwell. It is not expected that much will be effected by the rewards.507
Sister Emma continues very sick to day: the President was with her all day.—
 3 October 1842 • Monday
Monday 3rd. Sister Emma a little better. The president with her all day.
 4 October 1842 • Tuesday
Teusday 4th. Sister E. [Emma Smith] is very sick again to day. President Joseph attended with her all the day, himself being somewhat poorly.—
 5 October 1842 • Wednesday
Wednesday 5th. Sister E. [Emma Smith] is worse, many fears are entertained that she will not recover. She was baptised twice in the river which evidently did her much good.508 She grew worse again at night and continues very sick indeed. President Joseph does not feel well, and is much troubled on account of Sister E’s sickness. Elder [Sidney] Rigdon called El’r [Elder] W[illiam] Clayton into his office and said he had some matters to make known. He had been at Carthage and had conversation with Judge [Stephen A.] Douglas concerning Gov. [Thomas] Carlins proceedings &c. He had ascertained that Carlin had intentionally issued an illegal writ expecting thereby to draw President Joseph to Carthage to get acquited by Habeus Corpus before Douglas, and having men there waiting with a legal writ to serve on Prest. Joseph as soon as he was released under the other one and bear him away to Missouri, without further ceremony. E’r [Elder] Rigdon asked what power the Govrs. proclamation gave to any man or set of men who might be disposed to take Prest. Joseph. He was answered “Just the same power and authority which a legal warrant gave to an officer”.
It is more and more evident that Carlin is determined to have the President taken to Missouri if he can; but may the Almighty Jehovah shield and defend his servant from all their power, and prolong his days in peace that he may guide his people in righteousness untill his head is white with old age. Amen [p. 206]
 6 October 1842 • Thursday
Thursday 6th. This day sister Emma is better, and although it is the day on which she generally grows worse yet she appears considerably easier. May the Lord speedily raise her to the bosom of her family that the heart of his servant may be comforted. Amen. Prest. Joseph is comfortable to day.—
 7 October 1842 • Friday
Friday 7th. This A.M. E’r [Elder] Elias Higbee stated about the same things as were stated by E’r [Elder] [Sidney] Rigdon two days ago, and also that he had been informed that many of the Missourians were coming to unite with the Militia of this State, voluntarily and at their own expense; so that after the court rises at Carthage if they dont take Prest Joseph there; they will come and search the city &c. It is likely that this is only report.
Sister E. [Emma Smith] is some better.— Prest. Joseph is cheerful and well.
From the situation and appearance of things abroad President Joseph concluded to leave home, for a short season untill there should be some change in the proceedings of our enemies; accordingly at 20 minutes after 8 o clock P.M. he started away in company with brothers John Taylor, Shadrach Roundey and Wilson Law and John D. Parker. They travelled through the night and part of next day and after a tedious journey arrived at bro. [blank] <​James​> Taylors well and in good spirits, where he intends to tarry at present.
Editorial Note
In an effort to avoid arrest for his alleged role in the assault on Lilburn W. Boggs, JS spent most of the next three weeks in hiding at the home of James Taylor on the Henderson River some thirty miles or more northeast of Nauvoo. Because JS’s clerks were not present, very little was recorded of his activities during this period.
 10 October 1842 • Monday
Monday 10th. E[lde]r [John] Taylor returned bringing favorable reports concerning Prest. Josephs health, spirits &c. Sister E. [Emma Smith] is yet gaining slowly.
 15 October 1842 • Saturday
Saturday 15th. Bro. Jno D. Parker arrived with favorable intelligence from the president. He is well and comfortable.—
 20 October 1842 • Thursday
Thursday 20th. Early this A.M. President Joseph arrived at home on a visit to his family. During the day he was visited by several of the brethren, who rejoiced to see him once more. Sister Emma is still getting better and is able to attend to a little business having this day closed contract, and received pay for a quarter Section of Land of brother Job V. Barnum.509
 21 October 1842 • Friday
Friday 21st. This evening President Joseph returned in company with John D. Parker to father [James] Taylors, judging it wisdom to keep out of the way of his enemies a while longer at least; although all is peace and quiet and a prospect that his enemies will not trouble him much more.
 23 October 1842 • Sunday
Sunday 23rd. This day the Temple Committee laid before the Saints the propriety and advantages of laying a temporary floor on the Temple that the brethren could henceforth meet in the Temple to Worship instead of meeting in the grove. This was the instructions of President Joseph: The saints seemed to rejoice at this privilege very much.510 [p. 207]
 28 October 1842 • Friday
Friday 28th. Soon after day-light this morning President Joseph returned home again to visit his family. He found sister E. [Emma Smith] some worse today the remainder of the family are well. In the afternoon he rode out into the city and took a little exercise, From the appearance of thinks [things?] abroad we are encouraged to believe that his enemies wont trouble him much more at present.
This day the brethren finished laying the temporary floor, and seats in the Temple; and its appearance is truly pleasant and chearing. The exertions of the brethren during the past week to accomplish this thing are truly praiseworthy
 29 October 1842 • Saturday
Saturday 29th. About 10 o clock this morning president Joseph rode up and viewed the Temple. He expressed his satisfaction at the arrangements made and was pleased the progress made in that sacred edifice. After conversing with several of the brethren and shaking hands with numbers who were very much rejoiced to see their Prophet again, he returned home; but soon afterwards went over to the store where a number of brethren and sisters were assembled who had arrived this morning from the neighborhood of New York, Long Island &c. After E[lde]rs [John] Taylor, [Wilford] Woodruff and Samuel Bennett had addressed the brethren and sisters President Joseph spoke to them considerable, showing them the proper course to pursue and how to act in regard to making purchases of land &c. He showed them that it was generally in consequence of the brethren disobeying or disregarding council, that they became dissatisfied and murmered; and many when they arrived here were dissatisfied with the conduct of some of the saints because every thing was not done perfectly right, and they get mad and thus the devil gets advantage over them to destroy them. He said he was but a man and they must not expect him to be perfect; if they expected perfection from him, he should expect it from them, but if they would bear with his infirmities and the infirmities of the brethren, he would likewise bear with their infirmities. He said, it was likely he would have again to hide up in the woods, but they must not be discouraged but roll on the city, the Temple &c. When his enemies took away his rights he would bear it and keep out of the way but “if they take away your rights I will fight for you.” After speaking considerable and giving them council he blessed them and departed. The company appear to be in good spirits.
 30 October 1842 • Sunday
Sunday 30th. This day the saints met to worship in the Temple and notwithstanding its largeness it was well fill’d. It had been expected that president Joseph would address them, but he sent word that he was so sick that he could not meet with them; consequently E[lde]r John Taylor delivered a discourse
In the P.M. President Joseph went to visit sick &c.511 [p. 208]

 1 November 1842 • Tuesday
November Tuesday 1st. A.M. President & sister E. [Emma Smith] rode up to Temple for the benefit of her health she is rapidly gaining. In the P.M. went to see Dr W[illar]d Richards who is very sick;512 afterwards being accompanied by his children and W. C. [William Clayton] rode out towards the farm. When going down the hill near Caspers the carriage got overbalanced and upset. President Joseph was thrown some distance from the carriage and the children all three almost under it. He arose and enquired if any of the children were killed but upon examination there was no one seriously hurt, Frederic G. W. [Frederick Smith] had his cheek bruised which was about the worst injury received. The horse, so soon as he felt the carriage upset sprang forward but soon entangled himself in some branches and threw himself down on some rails. After some little trouble we succeeded in disengageing the horse from the harness and raising him up. The horse was not much hurt, but the carriage was considerably damaged. It seemed miraculous how we escaped serious injury from this accident, and our escape could not be attributed to any other power than that of divine providence. We felt thankful to God for this instance of his kind and watchful care over his servant and house. Seeing the carriage so much broke it was thought best to return home, accordingly leaving the carriage and part of the harness, and putting the children in bro Stoddards Buggy we returned.
In the evening President Joseph and two children rode up to the Temple.

Editorial Note
JS’s journal from 9 December through 20 December 1842 chronicles the efforts of several of his friends—including William Clayton, who was keeping the journal at this time—to obtain a discharge of his debts through bankruptcy during a trip to Springfield, Illinois. JS himself remained in Nauvoo during this time. While in Springfield, JS’s friends also consulted with state officials and others about a possible course of action JS might pursue in regard to the ongoing effort to extradite him to Missouri to stand trial for his alleged involvement in the assassination attempt on Lilburn W. Boggs. These discussions provided Clayton with access to some of the documents that had been generated during the extradition attempt, as well as to letters to JS from newly elected Illinois governor Thomas Ford and United States district attorney Justin Butterfield, recommending that JS come to Springfield for a judicial review of his case. Clayton copied these documents and letters into this lengthy journal entry. A day-by-day account of JS’s activities resumed on 21 December following the party’s return to Nauvoo, when JS asked Willard Richards to serve as his private secretary and historian.
 9–20 December 1842 • Friday–Tuesday
Friday 9th. This day prest. Joseph went to chopping wood.
On this day President Hyrum [Smith] started in company with Willard Richards. William Clayton, Henry G. Sherwood, Benjamin Covey, Peter Haws, Heber C. Kimball, Reynolds Cahoon & Alpheus Cutler for Springfield. bro. Covey & prest. Hyrum to attend to his case and the others to attend to prest. Joseph’s case.541 542We arrived at Springfield on tues-day the 13th. about 3 P.M. Same evening we were visited by E[lde]r William Smith who is a member of the house of Representatives. He stated that the subject of the repeal of our charter had been brought before the house, and the house had referred the subject to the committee on Corporations. He had made a spirited speech before the house on the subject; and thought from the appearance of things that the only way to preserve our charter was, to present a resolution to repeal all the charters in the State, if they repealed the Nauvoo Charter.543 He stated that we had a many warm friends in both Houses who had determined that if our charter was repealed all the Charters in the State should, especially Springfield, Quincy & Chicago.544
It is evident that there would have been little said on this subject before the Houses, had not Governor [Thomas] Ford in his inaugural address, referred to it in strong terms. In that address he says545 “ [3 lines blank]
It was expected that Govr. Ford would not have recommended any alteration in our charter, inasmuch as there is no extraordinary privileges granted to the citizens of Nauvoo, more than is granted by the Springfield Charter, to the citizens of Springfield.546 Such however was not the case, and his remarks have in some measure added a new stimulus to our enemies to agitate the subject. It is, however, evident that Govr. Ford saw that his remarks were not of the wisest as he said to us afterwards that he regretted he had not recommended a repeal of all the charters in the State at the same time. [p. 212] We also had an interview with Judge [Stephen A.] Douglas who appeared very friendly and offered to assist us in our business as much as possible. He recommended us to petition the Govr. to revoke the writ & proclamation by Ex Gov. [Thomas] Carlin for the arrest of prest. Joseph.—547 On Wednesday the 14th. We went to see Mr [Justin] Butterfield the U.S. District Attorney. We stated to him our intention of visiting the Govr. and our object in so doing. He recommended the course and offered to assist us. We requested Mr Butterfield to prepare a petition548 which was done & accompanied by an affidavit of each of us present Also a copy of the affidavit of Ex- Govr. [Lilburn W.] Boggs of Missouri of which the following is a copy:—
 
“State of Missouri	ss
County of Jackson
This day personally appeared before me Samuel Weston a Justice of the Peace within and for the County of Jackson the Subscriber Lilburn W Boggs who being duly sworn doeth depose and say that on the night of the sixth day of May 1842 while sitting in his dwelling in the town of Independance in the County of Jackson, he was shot with intent to kill, and that his life was dispaired of for several days, and that he believes and has good reason to believe from Evidence and information now in his possession, that Joseph Smith commonly called the Mormon Prophet was accessary before the fact of the intended murder; and that the said Joseph Smith is a citizen or resident of the State of Illinois and the said deponent hereby applies to the Governor of the State of Missouri to make a demand on the Governor of the State of Illinois to deliver the said Joseph Smith commonly called the Mormon prophet to some person authorized to receive and convey him to the State and county aforesaid, there to be dealt with according to Law.
 
Sworn to and subscribed before me this 20th.		Lilburn W. Boggs”
day of July 1842	Samuel Weston J.P.
At 4 o clock P.M. we called upon Mr Butterfield who went with us to see the Govr.549 Mr Butterfield stated the object of our request and read a communication which he had wrote to E[lde]r Sidney Rigdon last October.550 He then read our petition and presented the papers to the Govr. remarking at the same time that the arrest was based upon far weaker premises than he had previously supposed, inasmuch as the affidavit of Ex Gov. Boggs said nothing about Joseph having fled from justice, but plainly said he was a resident of the State of Illinoi◊ and the constitution only authorizes the delivery up of a “fugitives from Justice to the Executive authority of the State from which he fled”.551 The Govr. in his reply stated that he had no doubt but that the writ of Gov. Carlin was illegal, but he doubted as to his authority to interfere with the acts of his predecessor. He finally concluded that he would state the case before the Judges of the Supreme Court552 at their counsel next day and whatever they decided on shall be his decision. He then stated his reasons for recommending a repeal of the charter and said he regretted that he had not recommended a repeal of all the charters. &c. [p. 213]
On thursday the 15th. we attended the U.S. District Court being the day appointed for hearing Joseph & Hyrum’s cases in Bankruptcy.553 At our request the cases was not brought on till tomorrow. During the day we endeavored to satisfy Mr Butterfield with security for the payment of a Judgement against prest. Joseph in favor of the United States. That judgement being the only hindrance to prest. Joseph receiving his dis-charge.554 In the evening we again waited on Mr Butterfield555 who stated that he had attended the council of the Judges, three of whom where of opinion that the Govr. ought to revoke the writ and proclamation, and three that he ought not to intefere with the acts of Ex Gov. Carlin. They considered that the present case would be a precedent for cases which might occur hereafter of a similar character consequently it would be best to have it tried on Habeus Corpus. Mr Butterfield said that all the Judges were unanimous in their opinion that pres. Joseph would be acquited on Habeas Corpus, and he thought that would be the best course to be pursued. He said there was no doubt but that the prest. might go to Springfield with safety and would certainly be discharged. On Friday the 16th. we again waited on Mr Butterfield and entered into arrangements in the name of the High Council of the church to secure the payment of the judgement.556 As soon as this was done he withdrew his objections against Prest. Hyrum who immediately obtained his dis-charge.557 Prest Josephs dis-charge could not be obtained until Mr Butterfield had wrote to the solicitor of the U.S. Treasury showing our propositions. If they were accepted a dis-charge will be immediately obtained.558
The meanness and animosity of president Josephs enemies may be perceived by comparing the Affidavit of Ex Govr. Boggs and the demand of Govr. [Thomas] Reynolds of Missouri, the latter is as follows;
“The Governor of the State of Missouri to the Governor of the State of Illinois Greeting:— Whereas:— it appears by the annexed document (the afft. of Boggs) which is hereby certified as authentic, that one Joseph Smith is a fugitive from Justice, charged with being accessary before the fact, to an assault with intent to kill, made by one O. P. [Orrin Porter] Rockwell on Lilburn W Boggs in this State, and it is represented to the Executive Department of this State, has fled to the State of Illinois. Now Therefore I Thomas Reynolds Governor of the said State of Missouri, by virtue of the authority in me vested by the Constitution and Laws of the United States, do by these presents, demand the surrender and delivery of the said Joseph Smith to Edward R. Ford who is hereby appointed as the agent to receive the said Joseph Smith on the part of this State.
L.S559 In testimony Whereof, I Governor of the State of Missouri have hereunto set my hand, and caused to be affixed the Great Seal of State of Missouri. Done at the city of Jefferson this 22nd. day of July in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred & forty two of the Independance of the United States the sixty seventh and of this State the twenty-third.
By the Governor Tho Reynolds
Jas L. Minor Secretary of State.” [p. 214]
On Saturday the 17th. Govr. Ford wrote the following letter to Prest. Joseph and sent it by us.
560“Springfield Decr. 17th. 1842
Dear Sir:— Your petition561 requesting me to rescind Govr. [Thomas] Carlins proclamation and recall the writ issued against you has been received and duly considered. I submitted your case and all the papers relating thereto, to the Judges of the Supreme Court; or at least to six of them who happened to be present. They were unanimous in the opinion that the requisition from Missouri was illegal and insufficient to cause your arrest, but were equally divided as to the propriety and Justice of my interference with the acts of Governor Carlin. It being therefore a case of great doubt as to my power, and I not wishing ever in an official Station to assume the exercise of doubtful powers; and in as much as you have a sure and effectual remedy in the courts, I have decided to decline interfering. I can only advise that you submit to the laws and have a Judicial investigation of your rights. If it should become necessary for this purpose to repair to Springfield I do not believe that there will be any disposition to use illegal violence towards you; and I would feel it my duty in your case, as in the case of any other person, to protect you with any necessary amount of force from mob violence whilst asserting your rights before the courts, going to and returning.
I am most respectfully yours
Thomas Ford.”
After receiving this letter we went to see Mr [Justin] Butterfield and shewed him the above letter. He immediately set down and wrote the following.—
562“Springfield December 17th. 1842
Joseph Smith Esqr.
Dear Sir:—
I have heard the letter read which Govr. [Thomas] Ford has written to you, and his statements are correct in relation to the opinion of the Judges of the Supreme Court. The Judges were unanimously of the opinion that you would be entitled to your discharge under a Habeas Corpus to be issued by the Supreme Court— but felt some delicacy in advising Govr. Ford to revoke the order issued by Govr. [Thomas] Carlin— my advice is, that you come here without delay and you do not run the least risk of being protected while here and of being discharged by the Sup. Court by Habeas Corpus— I have also a right to bring the case before the U.S. Court563 now in Session here, and there you are certain of obtaining your discharge— I will stand by you and see you safely delivered from your arrest.564
Yours truly
J[ustin] Butterfield”
After receiving these letters we considered it best to return as there was no further prospect of doing any thing further to advantage. From what we could learn there seems to be a good feeling manifested towards prest. Joseph by the citizens of Springfield in general and it is evident we have many friends there.
We started back this day and arrived in Nauvoo on tuesday the 20th. all well.
