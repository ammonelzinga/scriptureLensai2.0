Sunday July 7 th Meeting held in the open air as a large assemblage was expected to witness <​Lis[ten] to​> the farewell addresses of the 12 who were then about to take their departure on this most important mission. <​viz​> to the nations of the earth, and the Islands of the sea Elder John E. Page, being the first of the 12 present, opened the meeting by addressing a few words <​of an​> introductory nature after which singing and prayer were observed, when Elder Page, delivered a very interesting discource on the subject of the Book of Mormon recapitulating in short terms the subjects of a former discourse on the same subject— 35 [p. 6[b]] and afterwards proceeded to read portions from the the Bible and Book of Mormon concerning the best criterions whereby to judge of its authenticity. And then went on to show that no impostor would ever attempt to make such promises as are contained [in] pages 541 and 34th—36 which he did in a very satisfactory manner. <​& then bore testimony​> after which the meeting adjourned for one hour,—— Afternoon—— The meeting was again opened by prayer &c Elder John Taylor spoke on the subject of this dispensation— The other angel which John saw.— having the everlasting gospel to preach &c &37—— <​hee then bore testimony of the truth of the Book of Mormon &c &c​>
Elder [Wilford] Woodruffs address went chiefly to exhortation to the Saints to perseverance after which he bore his testimony also.
Eder Orson Hyde next came forward and having alluded to his own late fall, exhorted all to perseverance in the things of God, expressed himself one with his brethren, and bore testimony to his knowledge of the truth and the misery of falling from it.
Elder Brigham Young made some very appropriate remarks, and also bore testimony to the truth of these [p. 7] things, and gave an invitation to come forward and be baptized when three manifested their determination to renounce the world. and take upon themselves the name of Jesus Christ.
One brother was then confirmed after which President S[idney] Rigdon addressed the meeting in a very feeling manner, showing that it must be no small matter which <​could​> induce men to leave their families and their homes to travel over all the earth, amidst persecutions and trials such as always followed the preaching of this gospel; he then addressed himself to the twelve and gave them some cou[n]sel and consolation— as far as in his power. after which I (JS—) requested their prayers & promised to pray for them &c &c38
The meeting was large & respectable a large number were present who did not belong to our Church The most perfect order prevailed throughout, The meeting dismissed about 1/2 past five oclock. when we repaired to the waters and the three candidates were baptized & confirmed. [p. 8]
Editorial Note
Beginning in late June, malaria borne by the mosquitoes that infested the area’s swamplands spread among the Latter-day Saints. Parley P. Pratt later recounted that “a majority of the people were prostrated with malignant fevers, agues, etc.”39 JS spent most of this week and much of the following month ministering to the sick. Having been recently driven from Missouri, many still lived in crowded, ramshackle accommodations. Zina Huntington, whose mother died of the sickness 8 July, later recounted that JS “saw to our being taken care of, as well as circumstances would permit—for there were hundreds, lying in tents and wagons, who needed care as much as we. Once Joseph came himself and made us tea with his own hands, and comforted the sick and dying.”40 Among the sick were JS’s father and apparently his son Joseph Smith III.41 Brigham Young later recounted that JS “had taken the sick into his house and dooryard until his house was like an hospital, and he had attended upon them until he was taken sick himself and confined to his bed several days.”42

[p. 9] After which I spoke & admonished the church individually to set his house in order, to make clean the insid[e of] the platter,47 and to meet on the next sabbath to partake of sacrament in order that by our obedieence to the ordinances, we might be enabled to prevail with God against the destroyer, and that the sick may be healed.
All this week chiefly spent among the sick, who in general are gaining strength, and recovering health

29 September–6 October 1839 • Sunday–Sunday
Sunday 29th Meeting at own house After others had spoken, Spoke and explained concerning uselessness of preaching [p. 12] to the world about great judgements but rather to preach the simple gospel— Explained concerning the coming of the son of Man &c that all will be raised to meet him62 but the righteous will remain with him in the cloud whilst all the proud and all that do wickedly will have to return to the earth, and suffer his vengeance which he will take upon them this is the second death &c &c
Also that it is a false idea that the saints will escape all the judgements whilst the wicked suffer— for all flesh is subject to suffer— and “the righteous shall hardly escape”63 still many of the saints will escape— for the just shall live by faith—64 yet many of the righteous shall fall a prey to disease to pestilence &c and yet &c by reason of the weakness of the flesh and yet be saved in the kingdom of God65 So that it is an unhallowed principle to say that such and such have transgressed because they have been preyed upon by disease or death for all flesh is subject to death and the Saviour has said, “Judge not “lest ye be judged”.66
