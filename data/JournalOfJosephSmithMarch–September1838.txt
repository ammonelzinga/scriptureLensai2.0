Editorial Note
On the night of 12 January 1838, JS and Sidney Rigdon left Kirtland, Ohio, on horseback to escape the threat of arrest and violence. They stayed with friends in Norton, Ohio, until their families arrived. Enemies in pursuit, inclement weather, and lack of provisions complicated the journey. The families sometimes traveled together and sometimes apart until, in eastern Illinois, they separated because of sickness in the larger and more unwieldy Rigdon group, which included scribe George W. Robinson.5
At the beginning of their journey, JS and Rigdon wrote to William W. Phelps in Missouri requesting assistance.6 In response, the Missouri high council organized wagon teams to meet the families and help them finish their journey.7 John Barnard met JS and his family at Huntsville, Randolph County, Missouri—about one hundred miles from Far West, Missouri—and brought them to Far West in his carriage.8 The retrospective opening entry, penned by scribe Robinson after his arrival in late March, was apparently dictated by JS.
13 March 1838 • Tuesday
On the 13th. day of March I9 with my family and some others arrived within 8 milds [miles] of Far West and put up at brother Barnerds [John Barnard’s] to tarry for the night. Here we ware meet by an escort of bretheren from the town who came to make us welcome to their little Zion.10 On the next day as we ware about entering the town Many of the bretheren came out to meet us who also withe open armes welcomed us to their boosoms. We were immediately received under the hospitable roof of George W. Harris who treated us with all kindness possible. here we refreshed ourselves withe much sattisfaction after our long and tedious Journey and the bretheren braught in such necessaries as we stood in need of for our presant comfort and necessities.11
After being here two or three day’s my Brother Samuel [Smith] arrived with his family an[d] shortly after his arrival while walking with him & cirtain other bretheren the following sentements occured to my mind.—
Motto of the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints
Motto of the Church of Christ of Latterday Saints.12
The Constitution of our country formed by the Fathers of Liberty.
Peace and good order in society Love to God and good will to man.
All good and wholesome Law’s; And virtue and truth above all things
And Aristarchy13 live forever!!!
But Wo to tyrants, Mobs, Aristocracy, Anarchy and Toryism:14 And all those who invent or seek out unrighteous and vexatious lawsuits under the pretext or color of law or office, either religious or political.15
Exalt the standard of Democracy! Down [p. 16]
with that of Priestcraft, and let all the people say Amen! that the blood of our Fathers may not cry from the ground against us.
Sacred is the Memory of that Blood which baught for us our liberty.

Editorial Note
George W. Robinson here copied into the journal a series of transcripts or summaries, all but one of which pertain to JS’s reinforcement of his leadership of the church and the removal and replacement of several leaders. The first documents were from late summer 1837, when after months of determined opposition, JS finally moved against dissidents.19 On 3 September 1837 JS convened a conference in Kirtland, Ohio, that sustained him as president and “rejected” dissenting apostles and some others. The following day JS wrote a letter, here copied into this journal, to the Latter-day Saints in Missouri informing them of the stabilization of authority in Kirtland and including a copy of the conference minutes. The letter also warned them of Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and others who were or soon would be in Missouri and whose support JS questioned. A revelation dated 4 September, the same date as the letter, also declared that Missouri leaders John Whitmer and William W. Phelps must repent of certain unnamed offenses or be removed from office. Together, these documents raised questions about Cowdery and the entire Missouri presidency, all of whom were in Missouri by the time JS arrived there in early November 1837 to hold a conference with the same purpose as the September conference in Ohio. JS and church leaders aired and presumably resolved concerns about the Missouri leaders in a meeting the day before the conference and in the conference itself, but they did not reach agreement with Oliver Cowdery. After JS returned to Ohio, tensions and problems involving the Missouri presidency also resurfaced.20

Dear Brotheren
Oliver Cowdery has been in transgression,31 but as he is now chosen as one of the Presidents or councilors I trust that he will yet humble himself & magnify his calling but if he should not, the church will soon be under the necessaty of raising their hands against him Therefore pray for him, David Whitmer Leonard Rich & others have been in transgression but we hope that they may be humble & ere long make sattisfaction to the Church otherwise they cannot retain their standing, Therefore we say unto you beware of all disaffected Characters for they come not to build up but to destroy & scatter abroad,32 Though we or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Gospel or introduce [any other?] order of things <​than​> those things which ye have received and are authorized to received from the first Presidency let him be accursed,33 May God Almighty Bless you all & keep you unto the coming & kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ; Yours in the Bonds of the new <​covenent​>— J. Smith, Jr.

To the first Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Kirtland
Dear & well beloved brotheren. Through the grace & mercy of our God, after a long & tedious journey of two months & one day, I and my family arrived in th[e] city of Far West Having been met at Huntsville 120 miles from this by brotheren with teams & money to forward us on our Journey When within eight miles of the City of Far West We were met by an [p. 23] escort of bretheren from the city Who were T[homas] B. Marsh John Corril[l] Elias Higby [Higbee] & severel others of the faithfull of the West Who received us with open armes and warm hearts and welcomed us to the bosom of their sosciety On our arrival in the city we wire [were] greeted on every hand by the saints who bid us welcom; Welcome; to the land of their inheritance Dear bretheren you may be assured that so friendly a meeting & reception paid us Will [well] for our long seven years of servictude persecution & affliction in the midst of our enimies in the land Kirtland yea verily our hearts were full and we feel greatfull to Almighty God for his kindness unto us. The particulars of our Journey brotheren cannot weell be writen but we trust that the same God who has protected us will protect you also, and will sooner or later grant us the privilege of seeing each other face <​to​> face & of rehersing of all our sufferings We have herd of the destruction of the printing office which we presume to believe must have been occasioned by the Parrishites or more properly the Aristocrats or Anarchys as we believe, The saints here have provided a room for us and daily necessary’s which is brought in from all parts of the co. to make us comfortable, so that I have nothing to do but to attend to my spiritual concerns or the spiritual affairs of the Church The difficulties of the Church had been ajusted before arrival here by a Judicious High Council With T. B. Marsh & D[avid] W Patten who acted as Pres. Pro. Tem. of the Church of zion being appointed by the voice of the Council & Church Wm. W. Phelps & John Whitmer having been cut off from the Church,37 D[avid] Whitmer remains as yit The saints at this time are in union & peace & love prevails throughout, in a word Heaven smiles upon the saints in Caldwell. Various & many have been the falshoods writen from thence [p. 24] to this place, but have prevailed nothing, We have no uneaseness about the power of our enimies in this place to do us harm Br Samuel H Smith & family arrived here soon after we did in go[o]d health. Br B[righam] Young Br D[aniel] S. Miles & Br L[evi] Richards arrivd here when we did, They were with us on the last of our journey which ad[d]ed much to our sattisfaction, They also are well They have provided places for their families & are now about to break the ground for seed, Being under the hand of wicked vexatious Lawsuits for seven years past my buisness was so dangerous that I was not able to leave it, in as good a situation as I had antisipated, but if there are any wrongs, They shall all be noticed so far as the Lord gives me ability & power to do so,38 say to all the brotheren that I have not forgotton them, but remember them in my prayers, Say to Mother [Sarah] Beaman that I remembr her, Also Br Daniel Carter Br Stong [Ezra Strong] & family Br [Oliver] Granger & family, Finally I cannot innumerate them all for the want of room I will just name Br Knights [Vinson Knight] the Bishop &c. My best respects to them all for the want of room & I commend them and the Church of God in Kirtland to our Heavenly Father & the word of his grace, which is able to make you wise unto Salvation I would just say to Br. [William] Marks, that I saw in a vision while on the road that whereas he was closely persued by an innumerable concource of enimies and as they pressed upon him hard as if they were about to devour him, It <​&​> had seemingly attained some degre[e] of advantage over him But about this time a chariot of fire came and near the place and the Angel of the Lord put forth his hand unto Br. Marks & said [p. 25] unto him thou art my son come here, and immediately he was caught up in the Chariot and rode away triumphantly out of their midst and again the Lord said I will raise th[ee] up for a blessing unto many people Now the particulars of this whole matter cannot be writen at this time but the vision was evidently given to me that I might know that the hand of the Lord would be on his behalf

Editorial Note
The following letter, which concerns a potential land purchase, interrupts the series of documents dealing with dissenting church leaders. After transcribing this letter, George W. Robinson copied in four more documents in that series. Despite the Caldwell County “solution” to the “Mormon problem” in Missouri—namely, Caldwell County, and only Caldwell County, for the Mormons—by early 1838 shrewd observers of northwest Missouri saw the potential for competition between the Latter-day Saints and their neighbors beyond Caldwell County. In this letter David Thomas, an owner of land in Carroll County, suggested that the Latter-day Saints purchase land in that area as a strategic site for settlement and commerce. Thomas’s letter introduced JS to Henry Root, who visited JS on 1 April 1838. Church leaders later met with Thomas and Root and eventually agreed to purchase land from Root at De Witt, where Saints proceeded to settle.41

We are still willing to honour you, if you can be made to know your own interest and give up your notes, so that they can be corrected, and made fit for the press. But if not, we have all the materials for another, which we shall commence this week to write44

Editorial Note
In late January and early February 1838, Thomas B. Marsh and David W. Patten, senior members of the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Missouri high council investigated the actions and attitudes of the Missouri presidency—David Whitmer, William W. Phelps, and John Whitmer—and conducted a series of meetings of the general membership of the church in Caldwell County that resulted in the removal of the presidency from office. Marsh indicated that the proceedings were carried out according to instructions from JS.48 Phelps and John Whitmer were excommunicated on 10 March 1838, just days before the arrival of JS in Far West.49 A month later, with JS present, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and apostle Lyman Johnson were tried and excommunicated in separate proceedings. George W. Robinson recorded a summary of those proceedings in this journal.
The extent to which the church and its leaders should be involved in its members’ temporal affairs was a central issue in 1837 and 1838. Dissenters were critical of JS’s decisions and even of his very involvement in nonecclesiastical matters. The financial decisions of Oliver Cowdery and other leaders in Missouri, which were not in keeping with JS’s views of how church leaders should operate, were the basis for some of the charges against the Missouri presidency in January and February of 1838, charges that resulted in their removal from office.50 These decisions were also central in the April excommunication trial of Oliver Cowdery.
Cowdery faced nine charges relating to financial management and loyalty to JS and the church. The trial proceeded according to official instructions for trying “a president of the high priesthood” before a “common council of the church,” which consisted of a bishop acting as a “common judge” assisted by twelve high priests.51 In a letter written to the high council, Cowdery underscored his refusal to be “influenced, governed, or controlled, in my temporal interests by any ecclesiastical authority or pretended revelation what ever.” Denouncing JS’s ecclesiastical interventions in his personal financial affairs as a violation of “Constitutional privileges and inherent rights,” Cowdery announced his withdrawal from church membership.52

The Bishop and high Council assembled at the Bishops office, in trial of the above Charges April 12th 1838 After the organization of the Council the above Charges were read. Also a letter from O. Cowdery, as will be found recorded in the Church record of the city of Far West Book A.61 The 1st 2nd 3rd 7th 8th & 9th Charges were Sustained [p. 30] The 4th & 5th Charges were rejected62 & the 6th withdrawn Consequently he (O. Cowdery) was concidered no longer a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints Voted by the high Council that Oliver Cowdery be no longer a Committee to select locations for the gathering of the Saints63——
Editorial Note
The day following Oliver Cowdery’s trial, the Missouri high council tried former Missouri president David Whitmer for his membership in the church. At this high council hearing, Whitmer was to be tried as a high priest, which Whitmer rejected because he still considered himself president and refused to recognize as legitimate the earlier proceedings that removed him from office. Although the 7 November 1837 conference clarified that he presided only over the church in Missouri, Whitmer still believed that he should instead be tried not only as president in Missouri but as a president of the high priesthood and therefore not subject to the decision of a regular council of high priests—and that attending the council and “a[n]swering to charges as a High Priest, should be acknowledgeing the correctness and legality of those former assumed Councils.” Nonetheless, believing that the high council was determined to remove him at all costs—even, he charged, if it required violating the church order outlined in revelations—Whitmer announced by letter his withdrawal from the church’s “fellowship and communion.” After reading Whitmer’s letter, the council concluded that “it was not considered necessary to investigate the case, as he had offered contempt to the Council by writing the above letter” and that Whitmer was therefore “not worthy a membership in the Church,” whereupon he was excommunicated.64
This same day the high council also heard the case of Lyman Johnson, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve. The letter of charges against Johnson included specific instructions regarding an earlier judicial matter, instructions that Johnson rejected as a violation of his constitutional rights. He therefore responded to the letter by refusing to cooperate and by announcing his withdrawal from fellowship with the Saints until that matter was removed from the charges. Johnson’s hearing, which included testimony of a number of witnesses, resulted in his excommunication.65

For behold I will be with him and I will Sanctify him before the people for unto him have I given the Keys of this Kingdom and ministry even so— Amen.
Editorial Note
Up to this point in the journal, George W. Robinson apparently copied documents to catch up on recent events. From this point forward, the journal generally consists of regular entries, especially during the next six weeks. However, given the large size of the record book containing this journal, it is unlikely that Robinson carried it as he accompanied JS on various activities. A number of entries may have been written several days after the events.
27 April 1838 • Friday
Friday April the 27th 1838. This day was chiefly spent in writing a history of this Church from the earliest perion [period] of its existance up to this date, By Presidents, Joseph Smith Jr & Sidney Rigdon, myself also was engaged in keeping this record79
28 April 1838 • Saturday
Saturday 28th This morning Prests Smith & [Sidney] Rigdon & myself, were invited into attend the High Council; and accordingly attended, the buisness before the high council, was the trial of an case appealed, from the branch of the Church, near gymans [Guymon’s] horse mill; Whereas [blank] Jackson was plantiff, and Aaron Lyon defendant.80 Council called to order. T[homas] B. Marsh &. D[avid] W. Patten, Presiding, It appeared in calling the council to order, that some of the seats were vacated; the council then proceeded to fill those seats: &c. And as there appeared to be no persons to fill Said Seats, Eligible to that office; Presidents Smith & Rigdon, were strongly solisited to act as councilors, or to Preside, and let the then presiding officers sit on the council; &c. They accepted of the former proposal, and accordingly Prest. Smith was choosen to act on the part of the defence, and to speak upon the case, togeth[er] with Geo. W. Harris. and Prest. Rigdon, was chosen to act on the part of the prossecution, and to speak upon the case together with Geo. M. Hinkle, after the council was organized, and op[e]ned by prayer; the notorious case of Aaron Lyon, was called in question; after some arbitrarious81 speeches, to know whether witnesses should be admitted, to testify against A. Lyon, or whether he should have the privilege of confessing his own Sins, It was desided; that witnesses Should be admited, and also the writen testimo [p. 34]ny of the said wife of Said Jackson.82 Naw as to this man Lyon, it is a well known <​fact,​> and without contradiction, that he has been in transgression <​ever​> Since he first came into Kirtland, which is some four, or five years since, as appeared this day, by different witnesses, which are unimpeacible [unimpeachable]. Witnesses against the <​this​> man Lyon, were these 1,st Sarah Jackson, wife of said plantiff, Jackson. one <​an​>83 Br. Best:84 also Br. [Shadrach] Roundy. Br John P. Pound Barnand [Barnard]: also Br. Thomas Girmon [Guymon]; also Br Benjamin, and the plantiff;85 Which testimony says, Whereas, the plantiff, had some time last season, sent his wife from Alton, Illinois, to this country as he himself could not come, at that time, accordingly his wife Mrs Jackson, came and settled in the branch first above mentioned, Now the <​this​> man Lyon had settled in this branch also, and was their presiding high priest, and had gained to himself great influence in and on over that branch, and it also appears that the this man had great possessions, and (if we may judge from testimony given this day) calculates to keep them let the saints of God’s necessity necessities be what they may, and it also appears that this man was in want of a wife (if actions bespeak the desires of any man) consequently set his wits to work to get one, he commences by getting (as he said,) revelations from God, that he must marry Mrs Jackson, or that she was the woman for to make his wife, and it appeared that these revilations were frequently received by him, and shortly introdused them to Mrs. Jackson, It also was manifested that the old man had sagasity enough to know; that unless he used his priestly office, he to assist him in accomplishing his designs, <​he would fail in the attempt;​> he therefore told Mrs. Jackson that he had a had a revelation from god that her husband was dead &c. and that She must concent to marry him, or she would be forever miserable; for he had seen her future state of existance, and that she must remember, that whoom soever he blessed, would be blessed, and whom soever he cursed, would be cursed, [p. 35] influencing her mind if possible, to believe his power was sufficient, to make her forever miserable; provided she complied not with his request. &c.86 Accordingly, they came to an agreement, and were soon to be married, but fortunately or unfortunately for both parties previous to the nuptial arrival of the nuptial day, Behold!! to the asstonishment of our defendant, the husband of Mrs. Jackson arrived at home, and consequently, disanuled the proceedings of the above alluded parties,87 the old gentleman Lyon, at this time (if not before,) knew verry well, that his god who gave his these revelations, (if any revelations he had,) must of course be no less than the devil, and in order to paliate the justice of his crime, sadled the whole burden upon the devil, that in scourging the person, who had previously befriended him, and counseled him in his former days; peradventure he might extricate himself from the Snare, of his own setting, and dictation. But, alass!! to[o] late for the old man, the testimony, being closed, and the Sword of Justice, began to be unsheathed, which fell upon the old man like a scourge of ten thousand lashes, wielded by the hand of President S. Rigdon & George M. Hinkle, inspired by the spirit of justice, accompanied with a flow of elequence, which searched for the feelings, like the sting of so many scorpions, which served to atone for past iniquity. there were no feelings that were not felt after, there were no sores that were not probed, there were no excuses rend[e]red that were not exceptionable. After Justice had ceased to weild his <​its​> sword, Mercy then advanced to rescue its victom, which inspired the heart of President J. Smith Jr, & Geo W. Harris who, with profound elequence <​&​> with <​a​> deep & sublime thought, with clemency of feeling, spoke in faivour of mercy the defendant, but in length of time, while mercy appeared to be doing her utmost, in contending against justice, the latter at last gained the ascendency, and took full power over <​possession of​> the mind of [p. 36] the speaker,88 who leveled a voley of darts, which came upon the old man, like <​a​> huricanes upon the mountain tops, which seemingly, was about to sweep the victom entirely out of the reach of mercy, but amidst the clashing of the sword of Justice, mercy still claimed the victom, and saved him still in the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and in this last kingdom Happy is it for those whose sins (like this mans) goes before them to Judgement, that they may yet repent and be saved in the Kingdom of our God. Council desided, that inasmuch as this man, had confessed his sins, and asked for, forgiveness, and promised to mark well the path of his feet, and do, (inasmuch as lay in his power.) what God, Should required at his hand<​s​>. accordingly, it was decided, that he give up his license as High Priest, and stand as a member in the Church, this in consequence of his being concidered not capable of dignifying that office, &c Council Adjourned

Allthough, he being verry hoarse, with a bad <​Severe​> cold, yet being assisted, by the spirit, and power, of Allmighty God, was enabled to elucidated the policy, to the understanding of all present, Both of the Federal party, and also of the Democratic party, from the time of this <​their​> first appearance in our country; endeavering to give an impartial hearing on both Sides of the question, In consequence of One Gen Willsons [John Wilson’s] speech, delivered upon Politics in the same place, a short time previous to this:99 Who touched upon one side of the matter only; He being a Federalist, and knowing that for the good of his cause, and for the safety of his electionereing campaign: it would be policy for him to dwell on one side of the question onley; But the Politics of this Church (with but few exceptions onley,) are that of the Democracy; which is the <​Allso​> the feelings of the speaker <​who spoke​> this day, and <​all​> of <​ all​> the first presidency, It <​is​> my principles also.100 Prest Smith, and myself attended the Delivery of said speech and were highly edified

Thursday Friday 11th This day, the presidency attend[ed] the Council of the Bishop, in case of the trial of Wm E. Mc.Lellen [McLellin] & Doctor McCord,101 Who were found in transgression. Mr. Mc.Cord, arose, and said, he was sorry to troubl the council on his account, for he had intended to withdraw from the church, before he left the place. he also stated, he had no confidence in the work of God, neither in his Prophet, which he <​has​> raised up in these last days, and consequently should go his own way, he accordingly gave up his License, and departed Wm. E. Mc.Lellin, also said the same. He further said he had no confidence in the heads of the Church, beleiving they had transgressed, and got out of the way, and consequently <​he​> left of[f] praying and keeping the commandments of God, and went his own way, and indulged himself in his lustfull desires. But when he heard, that [p. 40] the first presidency, had made a general settlement and acknowleged their sins,102 he then began to pray again, and to keep the commandments of God. Though when interogated by Prest smith he said he had seen nothing out of the way himself but it was heresay, and thus he judged from heresay. But we are constrained to say, O!! foolish Man! what excuse is that thou renderest, for thy sins, that because thou hast heard of some mans transgression, that thou shouldest leave thy God, and forsake thy prayers, and turn to those things that thou knowest to be contrary to the will of God, we say unto thee, and to all such, beware! beware! for God will bring the[e] into Judgement for thy sins.103

Whereupon [p. 41] the Council voted to authorize the Bishop, to give or to make over to Prests. Joseph Smith Jr & Sidney Rigdon each an eighty of land,105 situate adjacent to the city Corporation which land is the property of the Church.

18 May–1 June 1838 • Friday–Friday
Friday 18th To day Presidents J Smith Jr & S[idney] Rigdon and T[homas] B. Marsh D[avid] W. Patten Bishop E Partridg [Edward Partridge] E[lias] Higbee, S[imeon] Carter, A[lanson] Ripley, myself and many others, left Far West to visit the north countries for the purpose of Laying off stakes of Zion, making Locations & laying claims for the gathering of the saints for the benefit of the poor, and for the upbuilding of the Church of God,108 We traveled this day to the mouth of Honey Creek, which [p. 42] is a tribuitary to Grand River, where we camped for the night, we passed this day a beautifull country of land, a majority of which is Prarie which signifies untimbered land and thickly covered with grass and weeds, there is a plenty of wild game in this land, such as Deer, Turkey, Hens, Elk, &.c. we saw a large black wolf, Prest smith put on his dog after the wolf and <​we​> followed on after, but the wolf out run us and we lost, the <​Him​> wolf we have nothing to fear in camping out except Rattle sknakes which are peculiar <​natural​> to this country, though not verry numerous, we turn our horses loose and let them feed in the prairie,
<​19 sat​> The next morning we struck our tents, and marched crossed Grand river at the mouth of Honey Creek at a place called Nelsons ferry, Grand River is as large beautifull deep and rapid stream and will undoubtedly admit of steam Boat and other water craft navigation, and at the mouth of honey creek is a splendid harbour for the safety of such crafts, and also for landing freight We next kept up the river mostly in the timber for ten miles, untill we came to Col. Lyman Wight’s109 who lives at the foot of Tower Hill, a name appropriated by Prest smith, in consequence of the remains of an old Nephitish Alter an Tower, In the after where we camped for the sabath, In the after part of the day, Prest<​s.​> smith and Rigdon and myself, went to Wights. Ferry about a half mile from this place up the river, for the purpose of selecting and laying claims to city plott near said Ferry, in Davis [Daviess] County Township 60, Range 27 & 28, and Sections 25, 36, 31, 30, which was called Spring Hill a name appropriated by the bretheren present, But after wards named by the mouth of [the] Lord and was called Adam Ondi Awmen [Adam-ondi-Ahman], because said he it [p. 43] is the place where Adam shall come to visit his people, or the Ancient of days shall sit as spoken of by Daniel the Prophet,110
<​20​> Sunday was spent principally at Adam Ondi Awmen, but at the close of the day we struck our tents and traveled about six miles north and camped for the knight, we had in company at this place Judge Morain [Josiah Morin] and company traveling also to the north, <​21 M[onday]​> in the morning after making some Locations in this place which is in Township 61 Range 27, & 28, we next returned to Robinsons Grove about two miles in order to secure some land near grand river which we passed the day previous, and finding a mistake in the <​former​> survey concluded to send the surveyor south 5 or 6 miles to obtain correct survey, we did so, and some of us taried to obtain water for the camp
In the evening we held a council, to consult the bretheren upon the subject of our journey to know whether it is wisdom to go immediately into the north country or to tarry here and about here to secure the land on grand river &.c. The Bretherin spoke their minds verrily <​verry​> freely upon the subject, Prest Smith said he felt impressed to tarry and secure the land near by, all that is not secured between this and Far West especially on grand river, Prest Rigdon said if they should go to north in this expedition he thought it best to go immediately to that place, but thought it best by all means, to secure the land near by on the river &c, The question was put by Prest Smith and carried unanymously in favour of having the land secured on the river and between this place and Far West,111 <​22​> The next day Prest Rigdon with a company went to the east of the camp and selected some of the best locations in the country, and returned with news of good locations in that vicinity yet [p. 44] to be secured, in that vicinity Prest Smith and myself followed on in their course, but could not find them and consequently returned to the camp in Robinsons Grove, we next scouted west in order to obtain some game to suply our necessities but found or killed none, we [saw?] some ancient antiquities about one mile West of the camp, which conscisted of stone mounds, appearently laid up in squire [square] piles, though somewhat decayed and obliterated, by the almost continual rains undoubtedly these were made to seclude some valuable treasures deposited by the aborigionees of this land112
<​20 3​> The next day we all traveled and located lands East, on Grove Creek and near the city of Adam Ondi Awman, towards knight Prest<​s​> smith & S, Rigdon went to Col. Wights and the remainder returned to the tents,
<​24​> The next morning the company returned to Grove Creek to finish the survey, Prest. Rigdon and Col. Wight also returned to the surveying, and Prst smith returned to Far West
<​25​> Friday this day our company went up the river and made some locations,113 in the after part of the day we struck our tents, and mooved to Col. Wights
<​26​> The next day we surveyed land across the river opposite Adam-Ondi-Awmen <​27​> sunday was spent principally at Col. Wights. <​28​> The next morning we started for home Far West. about noon we met <​Prst<​s.​>​> J Smith J and Hyram [Hyrum] Smith, and Some 15 or 20 others, who were going to seek locations in the north, we continued our way home where we arived Monday evening and found our families well &c, <​30​> th[e] 30 Prest Hyram Smith returned <​to​> Far West. Friday 1st of June Prest J Smith Jr returned on account of his wifes sickness who was delivered of a son114

Editorial Note
Though George W. Robinson’s journal keeping lapsed for most of June and July, he did summarize a pivotal month from 4 June through 4 July 1838 in two journal entries. JS spent much of June north of Far West in Daviess County, Missouri, at the newly designated Mormon settlement of Adam-ondi-Ahman, where he organized a stake on 28 June 1838115—one year after some of the first Mormon settlers in Daviess County had been warned by local residents that they must leave.116 However, on 17 June JS was present at Far West when his counselor Sidney Rigdon preached a provocative sermon. In response to ongoing activities of prominent excommunicated dissenters in Caldwell County that threatened to disrupt the community and undercut church leadership, Rigdon used as his text Matthew 5:13, likening the excommunicants to salt that had lost its savor and was “henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out, and trodden under foot of men.” According to one observer, JS seconded the thrust of Rigdon’s remarks.117 Following the “Salt Sermon,” George W. Robinson—the scribe for this journal—and eighty-two other Mormon men signed a letter warning Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, John Whitmer, William W. Phelps, and Lyman Johnson to leave Caldwell County within three days or be expelled by force. Later accounts claimed that the letter accused the excommunicants of counterfeiting and other crimes of deceit, stealing, and persecuting the Latter-day Saints through lawsuits.118 John Whitmer later recounted that Robinson, at the presidency’s instigation, began suing the named men, as well as Frederick G. Williams, “by attachment for debts” and soon seized most of their belongings.119 All but Phelps, who wrote to the church presidency of his good intentions and willingness to rectify any wrong he had committed, soon left Far West under threats of physical violence.120 Though driving the men from Far West may have eased tensions within the community, the subsequent agitations of the outcasts increased tension between the Latter-day Saints and Missourians in neighboring counties.121
In a 4 July oration at Far West, two and a half weeks after the Salt Sermon, Rigdon evoked the spirit of the United States Declaration of Independence by insisting that the Latter-day Saints must be free to act unhampered by persecution and specifically stated that they would not countenance vexatious lawsuits. After reviewing previous outrages suffered by the Latter-day Saints in Missouri, Rigdon concluded his speech by declaring that should opponents again use violence against the Latter-day Saints, the Saints would not only defend themselves but also wage “between us and them a war of extermination,” a threat that came back to haunt the Latter-day Saints in coming months.122 Rigdon’s defiant remarks were understood by adversaries as a declaration of independence from Missouri law.123

Monday 4th Prests. J Smith Jr S[idney] Rigdon [p. 45] Hyram [Hyrum] Smith & myself and others left this place for Adam Ondi Awman [Adam-ondi-Ahman], we stayed this knight at br. Moses Daileys [Daley’s], the next morning we went to Col. [Lyman] Wights. it rained and was somewhat wet We continued surveying and building houses &c for some time day after day, the Surveyors run out the city plott and we returned to Farr West This day was spent in diverse labors for the Church together with a greater share of this month and the ensuing one124
4 July 1838 • Wednesday
July 4th 1838 This day was spent in cellebrating the 4 of July in commemoration of the decleration of <​the​> Independance of the United States of America, and also to make our decleration of Independance from all mobs and persecutions which have been inflicted upon us time after time <​un​>till we could bear it no longer. being driven by ruthless mobs and enimies of the truth. from our homes our property confiscated our lives exposed and our all jeopardized by such conduct, We therefore met on this day in Far West Mo.125 to make our decleration of independance, and to Lay the cornerstones of the house of the Lord agreeably to the commandment of the Lord unto us given April 26th 1838, as recorded on Page<​s.​> 32, 33, & 34 Book A.—126 An address was deliverd by Prest S[idney] Rigdon,[.] Prest J Smith Jr Prest of the day, Prest H[yrum] Smith Vice Prest. & Prest. S. Rigdon Orator, R[eynolds] Cahoon Chief Marshial G[eorge] M. Hinkle, & J[efferson] Hunt, asst. Marshaul, and myself commanded the Regiment,127 The order of the day was most splendid and beautifull Several thousands of spectators were present to witness the sene, The address a was delivred on the public squire [square] under the hoisted flagg representing the Liberty and independence [p. 46] of these United States of America.
Shortly after Prests. J, Smith Jr S, Rigdon H. Smith and myself, left this place for Adam Ondi Awman [Adam-ondi-Ahman] we saw a deer or two on the way. Prest Smith set his dogs after them one of which was a gray hound which caut the deer but could not hold him, although he threw him down, yet he injoured the dog so badly that he let him go, and we lost him, The race was quite amusing indeed.
I would mention or notice something about O[liver] Cowdery David Whitmer Lyman E Johnson and Johnson Whitmer who b[e]ing guilty of bace iniquities and that to[o] manifest in all the eyes of all men, and being often entreated would continue in their course seeking the Lives of the First Presidency and to overthrow the Kingdom of God which they once testified off [of]. Prest Rigdon preached one sabbath upon the salt that had lost its savour, that it is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out, and troden under foot of men,128 And the wicked flee when no man pursueth,129 These men took warning, and soon they were seen bounding over the prairie like the scape Goat to carry of[f] their own sins130 we have not seen them since, their influence is gone, and they are in a miserable condition, so also it [is] with all who turn from the truth to Lying cheating defrauding & swindeling131
Some time past was spent in trying to obtain pay from these men who are named above, who have absconded, and endeavered to defraud their creditors [p. 47]
Editorial Note
At this point, George W. Robinson copied into the journal a number of documents. Regular journal entries do not resume until 26 July 1838. Robinson first copied a letter JS received on 6 July from returning missionaries Orson Hyde and Heber C. Kimball and one from JS’s brother Don Carlos en route from Kirtland, Ohio, to Far West with family and friends. Then in an entry for 8 July, Robinson recorded three Ohio revelations dated six months earlier—the day that JS left Kirtland for Far West—and five additional revelations dated 8 July. The revelations related to the leadership crisis and persecution in Kirtland and to the challenges of reordering church leadership and resources in Missouri. Sandwiched between the 12 January revelations and the 8 July revelations is Robinson’s brief summary of further developments he observed in June and early July as Latter-day Saint settlers poured into Caldwell and Daviess counties and residents from surrounding areas tried to assess the complaints of the dissenters who had recently been expelled from Caldwell County.

Dear Brother Joseph
In health peace & saf[e]ty we arrived in this place on monday last,133 from the scene of our labor during the past year after a passage of 31 days. We cannot give a full account of our labors now, but suffise it to say the standard of truth is reared on the other side of the great waters, and hundreds are now fi[gh]ting the good fight of faith, beneath the shade of its glorious banner. We have fought in the name of the Lord Jesus, and under the shadow of the cross we have conquered, Not an enimy has risen up against us, but that has fallen for our sakes, Every thing we have done has prospered, and the God of the Holy Prophets has been with us, and to him belongs the praise Our bretheren in the East are poor yet rich in faith and the peace of our God abides upon them, we have not interfeered with the priests at all except when we have been assalted by them, We have preached repentance & baptism & baptism & repentance, We have strictly attended to our own buisness and have let others alone We have experienced the truth of solomons words which are as follows When a mans ways please the Lord he maketh his enimies that they are at peace with him134 our enimies have seen their entire insufficincy to stand against the power of truth manifest through us, and have gone away and left us in peacefull possession of [p. 48]
the field, Concerning the Nicholatine Band of which you warned us against we would say God is not there, and we are not there, they deal in sand stone & bogus,135 but we in faith hope & Charity We have not means to situate our families in Far West at present and as we have not been chargable to the Church hitherto, we do not like to become a burthen to them in the extreme state of poverty to which they are reduced, We can preach the gospel when the Lord is with us, and by it we can live, and the time will come when we shall have means to settle with the saints. Kirtland is not our home, it looks dolefull here, We shall go westward as soon as we can, the folks here tell many dark and pittifull tales about yourself & others. but the faults of our bretheren is poor entertainment for us, We have no accusation to bring for the Lord has shown us that he has taken the matter into his own hands, and every secret shall be braught to light and every man chastened for his sins, untill he confess and forsake them and then he shall fined mercy Therefore we can say we are at peace with God and with all mankind, and if any creature has aught against us, we have naught against him, and we say forgive us for Christ sake, We should be glad to see all our bretheren of the Twelve, and we s[h]all as we can consistantly, our good wishes and best respects to them To yourself Bro. Sidney [Rigdon] and families, and to all the faithfull bretheren and sisters in Christ Jesus our Lord, Will you or some other of the bretheren write us soon and let us know the true state of things in Far West, We have been gone allmost a year and have heard but very little, but we now hear much, We would like to know if a spirit of union prevails &c. &c. We are as ever your bretheren in the bonds of the everlasting covenant,

be impeached by other witnesses before such Council, and when a descision is had by such and Council in Zion, it shall only be for Zion, it shall not answer for her stakes, but if such descision be acknowledged by the Council of her stakes, then it shall answer for her stakes, But if it is not acknowledged by the stakes, then such stake may have the privilege of hearing for themselves or if such descision shall be acknowledeged by a majority of the stakes, then it shall answer for all her stakes And again,
The Presidency of my Church, may be tried by the voice of the whole body of the Church in Zion, and the voice of a majority of all her stakes140 And again
Except a majority is had by the voice of the Church of Zion and a majority of all her stakes, The Charges will be concidered not sustained and in order to sustain such Charge or Charges, before such Church of Zion or her stakes, such witnesses must be had as is named above, that is the witnesses to each President, who are of long and faithfull standing, that cannot be immpeached by other witnesses before the Church of Zion, or her stakes, And all this saith the Lord because of wicked and asspiring men, Let all your doings be in meekness and in humility before me even so Amen—141

7–9 August 1838 • Tuesday–Thursday
Tuesday the 7th This morning an alarm come from Galliton [Gallatin] the County seat of Davi[es]s County. that during the Election on yesterday at that place some two or three of our bretheren were killed in consequence of the Malignity of the Missourians,181 it was reported that the citizens of Daviess County who were opposed to our religion, did endeavor to prohibit the bretheren from voting at the election in that place, and that, the men who were killed were left upon the ground and not suffered to be intered, and that the majority of that county were determined to drive the [p. 65] bretheren from the county, under these conciderations quite a number of us volunteered to go to the assistance of our bretheren in that place accordingly some 15 or 20 men started from this place armed and equipt for our defence182 the bretheren from all parts of the County, followed after and continued to come and join us,183 and before we arrived at Col. [Lyman] Wights we had quite a large company Prest.<​s.​> Smith and [Sidney] Rigdon and H[yrum] Smith, alll the first presidency, General [Elias] Higbee Gen. [Sampson] Avard myself184 and many others to[o] tedious to mention at this time or in this record, were in the company, it was put upon me to take the command in consequence of my holding the office of Colonel. whose duty it is to command one regiment, we marched without much intermision untill we reached Col. Wights, however some of our small parties were attacked, I think on twice in going over, but, no serious injury done, we reached Col. Wights that same evening found some of the bretheren assembled for to receive council upon what to do ac. [&c] as a number of thes[e] men who were at the battle the day before, were there and I believe all of them, and were threatened with vengence by some of their enimies, some of the bretheren were wounded badly but none killed, quite a number of the Missourians were badly wounded some with their sculs cracked as reported, about 150 Missourians faut against from 6 to 12 of our bretheren,185 our bretheren faut like tigers they cleared the ground at that time, in knocking down and drag[g]ing out, the principal men who faught so bravely were John L Butler, Hyram [Hiram] Nelson, [p. 66] whose names aught to be immortalized, from the courage the<​y​> possessed and their determination in this thing and for the victory they gained
We tarried all knight at that place and in the morning we called to se[e] squire Adam Black who was mainfestly an enimy of ours, for the evidences were before us that he did last summer unite himself to a band of mobers to drive our brethern from the County and to prohibit them from settleing in the County and that personally warned many of said bretheren to leave in a certain given time or they should be further delt with,186 he was obliged to confess this when interrogated upon the subject and in consequences of the violation of his oath as a magistrate in the County of Daviess, we required him to give us some sattisfaction so that we might know whether he was our friend or enimy, and whether he would adminester the laws of our country or not in justice for people, we presented him with a paper to sign which was an article of peace, but he being jealous of us would not sign it but said he would draw one himself and sign it to our sattisfaction, he did so, and we left him in peace,187 The same evening some of our the citizens of the County came to visit us to sue for peace,188 we told them we would [meet?] their principal men in a committee on the next day at that place at twelve o,clock, accordingly we did so, and entered into a covenant of peace with their principal men of said County for inst[ance] Judge [Josiah] Morin Mr. [John] Williams Mr. [James] Turner Mr. [Jacob] Rogers and many others189 [p. 67] The covenant of peace was to preserve each others rights, and stand in their defence, that if men should do wrong they, neither party should uphold them or endeavour to secret them from Justice but they shall be delivered up even all all offendrs to be delt with according to law and Justice Upon these terms we parted in peace, and soon every man left the ground and returned to his habitation,190 we came home the same knight arrived at home about 12 Oclock at knight, and found all well in Far West

Revelation for Thomas B. Marsh • 23 July 1837
A Revelation207 given Kirtland July 23rd. 1837.
The word of the Lord unto Thomas, B. Marsh concerning the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.208
Verily thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Thomas, I have heard thy prayers and thine alms have come up as a memorial before me in behalf of those thy brethren who were chosen to bear testimony of my name and to send it abroad among all nations, kindreds, tongues and people and ordained through the instrumentality of my servants.
Verily I say unto you there have been some few things in thine heart and with thee, with which I the Lord was not well pleased; nevertheless inasmuch as thou hast abased thyself thou shalt be exalted: therefore all thy sins are forgiven thee. Let thy heart be of good cheer before my face, and thou shalt bear record of my name, not only unto the Gentiles, but also unto the Jews; and thou shalt send forth my word unto the ends of the earth.
Contend thou therefore morning by morning, and day after day let thy warning voice go forth; and when the night cometh let not the inhabitants of the earth slumber because of thy speech. Let thy habitation be known in Zion, and remove not thy house, for I the Lord have a great work for you <​thee​> to do, in publishing my name among the children of men, therefore gird up your loins for the work. Let your feet be shod also for thou art chosen, and thy path lyeth among the mountains and among many nations, and by thy word many high ones shall be brought low; and by thy word many low ones shall be exalted, thy voice shall be a rebuke unto the transgressor, and at thy rebuke let the tongue of the slanderer cease its perverseness. Be thou humble and the Lord thy God shall lead thee by the hand and give thee an answer to thy prayers, I know thy heart and have heard thy prayers concerning thy brethren. Be not partial towards them in love above many others, but let your love be for them as for yourself, and let your love abound unto all men and unto all who love my name. And pray for your brethren of the twelve. Admonish them sharply for my name’s sake, and let them be admonished for all their sins, and be ye faithful before me unto my name; and after their temptations and much tribulation behold I the Lord will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts and stiffen not their necks against me they shall be converted and I will heal them.
Now I say unto you, and what I say [p. 72] unto you, I say unto all the twelve. Arise and gird up your loins, take up your cross, follow me, and feed my sheep. Exalt not yourselves; rebel not against my servant Joseph for Verily I say unto you I am with him and my hand shall be over him; and the keys which I have given him, and also to youward shall not be taken from him untill I come.
Verily I say unto you my servant Thomas, thou art the man whom I have chosen to hold the keys of my kingdom (as pertaining to the twelve) abroad among all nations, that thou mayest be thy my servant to unlock the door of the kingdom in all places where my servant Joseph, and my servant Sidney [Rigdon], and my servant Hyrum [Smith], cannot come, for on them have I laid the burden of all the Churches for a little season: wherefore whithersoever they shall send you, go ye, and I will be with you and in whatsoever place ye shall proclaim my name an effectual door shall be opened unto you that they may receive my word. Whosoever receiveth my word receiveth me, and whosoever receiveth me receiveth those (the first presidency) whom I have sent, whom I have made counsellors for my name’s sake unto you. And again I say unto you, that whosoever ye shall send in my name, by the voice of your brethren the twelve, duly recommended and authorized by you, shall have power to open the door of my kingdom unto any nation whithersoever ye shall send them, inasmuch as they shall humble themselves before me and abide in my word, and hearken to the voice of my spirit.
Verily verily! I say unto you, darkness covereth the earth and gross darkness the people minds of the people, and all flesh has become corrupt before my face! Behold vengeance cometh speedily upon the inhabitants of the earth. A day of wrath! A day of burning! A day of desolation! Of weeping! Of mourning and of lamentation! And as a whirlwind it shall come upon all the face of the earth saith the Lord. And upon my house shall it begin and from my house shall it go forth saith the Lord. First among those among you saith the Lord; who have professed to know my name and have not known me and have blasphemed against me in the midst of my house saith the Lord
Therefore see to it that you trouble not yourselves concerning the affairs of my Church in this place saith the Lord, but purify your hearts before me, and then go ye into all the world and preach my gospel unto every creature who have not received it and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not, and is not baptized [p. 73] shall be damned. For unto you (the twelve) and those (the first presidency) who are appointed with you to be your counsellors and your leaders, is the power of this priesthood given for the last days and for the last time, in the which is the dispensation of the fulness of times: which power you hold in connection with all those who have received a dispensation at any time from the beginning of the creation, for verily I say unto you the keys of the dispensation which ye have received have came down from the fathers; and last of all being sent down from heaven unto you. Verily I say unto you, Behold how great is your calling.
Cleanse your hearts and your garments, lest the blood of this generation be required at your hands. Be faithful untill I come for I come quickly and my reward is with me to recompense every man according as his work shall be! I am Alpha and Omega. Amen.
The above revelation was given in Kirtland, and was not here in time to insert in its proper sequence209

31 August 1838 • Friday
Friday the 31st. Prest. Joseph spent some considerable time this day in conversation with br. John Corril[l], in consequence of some expressions made by him in pressence of some considerable number of bretheren present, who might perhaps be weak in the faith, as they had not been long in the place, therefore consequently were made verry unwisely,210 Br. Corrils. conduct for some time past, has been verry unbecoming indeed especially a man in whoom so much confidence has been placed, He has been difficulted to keep track and walk step, by step, with the great wheal which is propelled by the arm of the great Jehovah, he says he will not yeald his Judgement, to any thing proposed by the Church, or any individuals of the Church, or even the voice of the great (I am,) given through the appointed organ, as revelation, but will always act upon his Judgement [p. 74] let him believe in whatever religion he may, he says he will always say what he pleases, for he says he is a republican, and as such he will do, say, act, and believe, what he pleases,211
Let the reader mark such republicanism as this, That a man should oppose his own Judgement to the Judgement of God, and at the same time profess to believe in the same God, when that God has said, “the wisdom of God, is foolishness with men, and the wisdom or Judgment of men is foolishness with God.212 Prest. [Sidney] Rigdon also made some observations to br. Corril, which he afterwards acknowleged were correct, and that he understood things different after the intervew, from what he did before,
Editorial Note
As September began, rumors of Mormon violence, fanned by Adam Black, William Peniston, and others, put northwestern Missouri on a war footing. Sheriff William Morgan had intended to arrest JS on 16 August but was ultimately dissuaded because of a jurisdictional issue.213 Within his own jurisdiction of Daviess County, Morgan apparently intended to arrest Lyman Wight as well but was intimidated by Wight’s defiant posture. Missouri newspapers reported that the sheriff went to Wight’s home with the intent of arresting him but found the home surrounded by armed Latter-day Saints. Wight was reported to have threatened “that he would not be taken alive—that the law had never protected him, and he owed them no obedience.”214 On 29 August 1838, Peniston and other members of a Daviess County “Committee of Vigilance” wrote that JS and Wight “say they will not be taken, nor submit to the law of the land” and that “two or three” attempts had been made to arrest them.215 By 2 September 1838, Peniston, Black, and other Daviess County residents had solicited aid from Ray, Livingston, Clay, Lafayette, Jackson, Carroll, Howard, Chariton, and possibly other Missouri counties.216
On 4 September, in consultation with General David R. Atchison, JS and Wight agreed to be tried on charges stemming from Adam Black’s affidavit, with Atchison and Alexander Doniphan to serve as their legal counsel. They requested that circuit court judge Austin A. King of Richmond, Clay County, conduct a preliminary hearing on the matter in Daviess County. King agreed to do so “for the sake of giving quiet to the country” and instructed Sheriff William Morgan of Daviess County to “go to Mr. Wight who will submit to your process . . . when you go to execute your process on Wight you need take no one with you.”217 The hearing took place on 7 September, but it failed to bring peace to Daviess County as outsiders continued to mobilize—now not merely to bring JS and Wight to justice but to drive the Mormons from the county.
1 September 1838 • Saturday
Saturday 1st. Sept. 1838 — — — — — — — The first Presidency their Scribe, & Judge [Elias] Higbee (as surveyor,) Started this morning for the halfway house218 (as it is called) Kept [by] br. [Waldo] Littlefield, some 14 or 15 miles from Far West directly north, For the purpose of appointing a city of Zion, for the gathering of the saints in that place, for safety and from the storm which will soon come upon this genneration,219 and that the bretheren may be together in the hour of the coming of the son of man and that they may receive instruction<​s​> to prepare them for that great day which will come upon this generation as a thief in the knight,220
There is great exitement at present among the misourians seeking if possible an accasion against us they are continually chafing us, and provoking us to anger if possible, one sene of threats threatning after an=other.221 but we do not fear them [p. 75] For the Lord God the eternal Father is our God and Jesus the mediator is our saviour, and in the great I am, is our strength and confidence we have been driven time after time and that without cause and smitten again and again, and that without provocation, untill we have prooved the world <​wordd​> with kindness, and the world <​wordd​> proved us, that we have no designs against any man or set of men That we injure no man. That we are peasibl with all men, minding our own buisness, and our buisness only, we have Suffered our rights and our liberties to be taken, from us, we have not avenged ourselves of those wrongs, we have appealed to magistrates, to Sheriffs, to Judges, to govonour<​s​> and to the President of the United States, all in vain,222 yet we have yealded, peacibly to all these things, we have not complained at the great God, we murmur<​ed​> not, but peacibly left all, and retired into the back Country in the broad and wild Prairie, in the barren & desolate plains, and there commenced anew, we made the desolate places to bud and blosom as the rose, and now the fiend like rase are disposed to give us no rest, Their Father (the Devil) is hourly calling upon them to be up and doing, and they like willing and obedient children need not the second admonition, But in the name of Jesus Christ the Son of the Living God we will do it endure it no longer, if the Great God will arm us with courage, with strength and with power, to resist them in their persecutions. We will not act on the offensive but always on the defensive, our rights and [p. 76] our rights and our liberties shall not be taken from us, and we peacibly submit to it, as we have done heretofore, but we will avenge ourselves of our enimies, inasmuch as they will not let us alone,223 But to return again to our subject We found the place for the city, and the bretheren were instructed to gather immediately into it, and soon they should be organised according to the Laws of God,* <​*A more particular history of this city will be given hereafter, perhaps at the <​at its​> organization and dedication,—​>224
We found a new route home saving I should think 3 or 4 miles, we arrived at Far West about Day light down
2 September 1838 • Sunday
Sunday 2nd. The first Presidency attended worship as usual the fore part of the Day, Prest. & myself <​Smith​> did not attend in the after part of the day, but retired to Prest. Smiths. to examine the church records. Br. Joseph spent some considerable part of the afternoon in company with a gentlemen from Livingston County, who had become considerable ex[c]ited, on account of a large collection of people saying to take Joseph Smith Jr. & Lyman Wight, for going to one Adam Blacks. as has been previously stated, and recorded in this record,225 and as they said Prest. Smith and Col. Wight, had resisted the officer, who had endeavoured to take them etc. and accordingly these men were assembling to take them (as they said) They are collecting from every part of the Country to Daviess County. report says they are collecting from Eleven Counties,226 to help take two men [p. 77] who had never resisted the Law or officer, neither thought of doing so, and this they knew at the same time, or many of them at least,227 This looks a leettle to[o] much like mobocracy, it foretells some evil intentions, the whole uper Missouri is all in an uproar and confusion,228 This evening we sent for General [David R.] Atchison of Liberty Clay County, who is the major General of this division, we sent for him to come and counsil with us, and to se[e] if he could not put a stop to this collecion of people, and to put to a stop to hostilities in Daviess County,229 we also sent a letter to Judge [Austin A.] King containing a petition, for him to assist in putting down and scattering the mob, which are collecting at Daviess,230
3 September 1838 • Monday
Monday Sept. 3rd. Nothing of importance transpired this day, onley reports concerning the collection of the mob. in Daviess County Which in part has been collecting and collected ever since the election in Daviess which was on the sixth of August last as has been heretofore mentioned.
This evening General [David R.] Atchison arrived in Town
4 September 1838 • Tuesday
Tuesday 4th This day was spent in council with the Gen. [David R. Atchison] He says he will do all in his power to disperce the mob. &c. We employed him and [Alexander] Doniphan (his partner)231 as our Lawyer and counselor in Law, They are concidered the first Lawyers in the Uper Missouri, Prest. [Sidney] Rigdon & myself commenced this day the studay of Law under General<​s.​> Atchison & Doniphon [p. 78] They think by dilligent application we can be admitted to the bar. in twelve month<​s.​>.232 The result of the council was, that, Prest. Smith & Col. [Lyman] Wight volunteer and be tried by Judge [Austin A.] King in Daviess County (Col Wight.) being present being previously notified to attend the council. Accordingly Thursday next was appointed for the trial,233 and word to that amount, was sent to Judge King (who had priviously agreed to volunteer and try the case) to meet all at br. [Waldo] Littlefields. near the county line south of Daviess,234
We all return
5 September 1838 • Wednesday
Wendnersday 5th Judge [Austin A.] King came to town, on his way to Daviess, to meet the above named engagement Gen. [David R.] Atchison had gone before Judge King arrived, the Judge stayed all knight,235
6 September 1838 • Thursday
Thursday the 6th Prest. Smith repaired to br. [Waldo] Littlefields to stand trial, he was accompanied by several of the bretheren among whoom was Prest. Hyram [Hyrum] Smith Judge E[lias] Higbee & myself &c. &c. Prest Smith thought it not wisdom to make his appearance before the public in consequence of the many threats made against him and the high state of exitement in that place, The trial could not go on in consequence of the absence of the Plaintiff236 and lack of testimony, consequently the court adjourned till tomorrow at 10 Oclock at A Mr. [John] Raglins some 6 or 8 miles farther south, and also he is a real mob character, he lives within [p. 79] one half mile of Caldwell County line,237 We all returned this evening to Far West,
7 September 1838 • Friday
Friday the 7th We all met at [John] Raglins agreeable to adjournment,
We did not know but there would be a distirbance among the mob characters, today,238 we accordingly had an army of men placed at the county line so as to be ready at a minuits warning if there should be any difficulty at the trial,239 the trial commenced Mr. Penningston [William Peniston] who was the prossecutor had no witnesses but Adam Black who contrived to swear a great may things that never had an existace [existence] untill he swore them and I presume, never entered the heart of any man240 And in fine I think he swore by the Job. (as he was employed so to do by Penningston.)
The witnesses on the part of the defence was Dimick B. Huntington, Gideon Carter Adam Lightner & myself,241 The Judge bound Prest Smith & Col. [Lyman] Wight over to court in a five hundred dollar bond,242 there was no proof against them criminal, but it is suposed he did it to pasify as much as possible the feelings of the mobers. he (the Judge) stating after in my presence that there was nothing proven against them worthy of bonds,243 but they submitted without murmering a word, gave the bonds with sufficient securities, and all returned home the same evening, We found two persons in Daviess at the trial, from, which Gentlemen were sent from Charriton [Chariton] County as a committe to enquire into all this matter. as the mobers had sent [p. 80] to that place for assestance, they said to take Smith & Wight, but their object was to drive the brethren from the County of Daviess as was done in Jackson County, They said the people in Charriton did not se[e] proper to send help without knowing for what purpose they were doing it, and this they said was their errand, They came home with us, to hold a council with us, in order to learn the facts of this great exitement, which is as it were turning the world up side down,244
8 September 1838 • Saturday
Saturday the 8th. Sept. The Presidency met in council with the committe above named, from Charriton [Chariton] County, together with General [David R.] Atchison, where a relation was given of this whole matter, the present state of exitement and the cause of all this confusion,245 These Gentlemen expressed their fullest sattisfaction upon this matter considering they had been outrageously imposed upon, in this matter, They left this afternoon appearntly perfectly sattisfied with the interview,246 News came this evening that the mob were to attack Adam Ondi Awman [Adam-ondi-Ahman],
9 September 1838 • Sunday
Sunday the 9th This morning a company in addition to what went last evening went to Adam Ondi Awman [Adam-ondi-Ahman] to assist the bretheren there in their defence against the mob.247 Capt. Wm Al[l]red took a company of ten men, all mounted, and went to entrsect a team with guns and amunition from Richmond for the mob in Daviess,248 they found the wagon broke down and the boxes of guns drawn into the high grass near by the wagon [p. 81] no one present that could be discovered, in a short time two men [on] horse back came from towards the camp of the mob and immediately behind them was a man with a wagon, they all came up and were taken by virtue of a writ supposing them to be the men who were abetting the mob. in carying the guns and amunition to those murderers, Yea and murderers to[o]! in cool blood,
The men were taken together with the guns to Far West the guns were destributed among the bretheren for their defence, and the prisoners were held in custorday,
This was a glorious day indeed the plans of the mob were fruustrated in loosing their guns, and all th[e]ir efforts appeared to be blasted, or blast[ed] before carried into effect, The mob continue to take prisioners at their pleasure some th[e]y keep and some they let go,249 they try all in their power to make us commit the first act of violence they freeqently send in word that they are tortureing the prisioners to death, in the most agravvating manner, but we understand all their ways, and their cunning and wisdom is not past finding out
10 September 1838 • Monday
Monday 10th Today we proceeded to trial of those prisioners they said they wished for an opportunity of getting bail so as to obtain counsil; they were given to understand that no bail could be taken, for this purpose, but that he could have a sufficient time to send for counsil if he wished, the court accordingly adjourned untill Wendnessday [p. 82] following,
The Prisioners names were John B Comer Alem [Allen] Miller Wm. L McHaney, They were braught before Albert Petty a Justice of the Peace in Far West250
Editorial Note
Following his entry for 10 September, George W. Robinson inscribed a dateline, indicating an unfulfilled intention to continue record keeping. The abrupt end of Robinson’s record probably related to his responsibilities as an officer in the Mormons’ Caldwell County militia. At the time this journal was set aside, brief entries were already being made in another journal by clerk James Mulholland.
JS and Sidney Rigdon wrote to Judge Austin A. King asking what should be done with prisoners Comer, Miller, and McHaney and the stolen rifles. King directed that they should release the prisoners.251 On 12 September, Petty convened a preliminary hearing at which evidence was presented and the prisoners were held to bail to appear at the next session of the circuit court.252 Brigadier General Alexander Doniphan arrived at Far West later that day with orders from Major General David R.
