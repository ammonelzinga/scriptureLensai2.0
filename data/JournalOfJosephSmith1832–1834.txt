Editorial Note
Ten months passed before JS wrote another entry. In that period he dictated several revelations as he continued revising the Bible, completing his work in July 1833. Organizing and meeting with the School of the Prophets occupied much of his time from January through April. In June, JS and the presidency developed plans for temples in Kirtland and Missouri and for expanded Mormon settlement in each city. In August, JS learned that during the previous month vigilantes had destroyed the church’s printing office and store in Jackson County and that the Missouri Latter-day Saints had signed an agreement to evacuate Jackson County by spring 1834. In September, JS helped organize efforts in Kirtland to resume the church’s printing operations. JS renewed his journal keeping in October 1833 as he prepared to proselytize in northeastern Pennsylvania, western New York, and Upper Canada. After he returned to Kirtland a month later, journal entries continued for several weeks.

Williams] is a man who is one of those men in whom I place the greatest confidence and trust for I have found him ever full of love and Brotherly kindness he is not a man of many words but is ever wining because of his constant mind he shall ever have place in my heart and is ever intitled to my confidence He is perfectly honest and upright , and seeks with all his heart to magnify his presidency in the church of ch[r]ist , but fails in many instances , in consequence of a lack <​want​> of confidence in himself : God grant that he may [p. 23] overcome all evil : Blessed be  brother Frederick, for he shall never want a friend; and his generation after him shall flourish. The Lord hath appointed him an inheritance upon the land of Zion. Yea, and his head shall blossom<​ . And he shall be​> as an olive branch that is bowed down with fruit : even so ; Amen.
And again, blessed be  brother Sidney , also , notwithstanding he shall be high and lifted up, yet he shall bow down under the yoke like unto an ass that [p. 24] coucheth beneath his burthen; that learneth his master’s <​will​> by the stroke of the rod : thus saith the Lord. Yet the Lord will have mercy on him, and he shall bring forth much fruit ; even as the vin vine of the choice grape when her clusters are <​is​> ripe , before the time of the gleaning of the vintage : and the Lord shall make his heart merry as with sweet wine because of him who putteth forth his hand and lifteth him up from <​out of​> deep mire, and pointeth him out the way, and guideth his [p. 25] feet when he stumbles ; and humbleth him in his pride. Blessed are his generations. Nevertheless, one shall hunt after them as a man hunteth after an ass that hath strayed in the wilderness , & straitway findeth him and bringeth him into the fold. Thus shall the Lord watch over his generation that they may be saved : even so ; Amen.32

11 January 1834 • Saturday46
 January 11, 1834. This evening Joseph Smith Jr., Frederick G. Williams, Newel K. Whitney, John Johnson, Oliver Cowdery, and Orson Hyde united in prayer47 and asked the Lord to grant the following petition: [p. 43]
Firstly, That the Lord would grant that our lives might be precious in his sight, that he would watch over our persons and give his angels charge concerning us and our families that no evil nor unseen hand might be permitted to harm us.
Secondly, That the Lord would also hold the lives of all the United Firm, and not suffer that any of them shall be taken.
Thirdly, That the Lord would grant that our brother Joseph might prevail over [p. 44] his enemy, even  Docter P. [Doctor Philastus] Hurlbut,48 who has threatened his life, whom brother Joseph has <​caused to be​> taken with a precept;49 that the Lord would fill the heart of the Court with a spirit to do justice , and cause that the law of the land may be magnified in bringing him to justice.
Fourthly, That the Lord would provide, in the order of his Providence , the bishop of this Church 50 with means sufficient to discharge every debt that the Firm owes,51 in due season, that [p. 45] the Church may not be braught into disrepute , and the saints be afflicted by the hands of their enemies.
Fifthly, That the Lord would protect our printing press from the hands of evil men , 52 and give us means to send forth his word, even his gospel that the ears of all may hear it, and also that we may print his scriptures;53 and also that he would give those who were appointed to conduct the press , 54 wisdom sufficient that the cause [p. 46] may not be hindered, but that men’s eyes may thereby be opened to see the truth.
Sixthly, That the Lord would deliver Zion, and gather in his scattered people , to possess it in peace;55 and also, while in their dispersion, that he would provide for them that they perish not with hunger nor cold. And finally, that God in the name of Jesus would gather his elect speedily , and unveil his face that his saints [p. 47] might behold his glory and dwell with him ; Amen.
28 January 1834 • Tuesday
On the 13th of March A.D. 1833,  Docter P. [Doctor Philastus] Hurlbut came to my house; I conversed with him considerably about the book of Mormon. He was ordained to the office of an elder in this Church under the hand of Sidney Rigdon on the [blank] <​18th​> of March in the same year above written.56 According to my best recollection, I heard him say, in the [p. 48] course of conversing with him, that if he ever became convinced that the book of Mormon was false, he would be the cause of my destruction, &c .
He was tried before a counsel of high priests on the 21st day of June , 1833 , and his license restored to him again, it <​he​> previously having been taken by the Church at <​cut off from the​> Church by the bishop’s court. He was finally cut off from the church [p. 49] few days after having his license restored , 57 on the 21st of June . and then saught the distruction of the sainst [saints] in this place and more particularly myself and family and as the Lord has in his mercy Delivered me out of his hand . till the present and also the church that he has not prevailed viz th[e] 28 day of Jany [p. 50] 1834 for which I off[e]r the gratitud of my heart to Allmighty God for the sam[e] and on this night  Bro Olivr [Oliver Cowdery] and  bro Frederick [G.

Editorial Note
On 17 February 1834, JS organized a high council, which would serve “the purpose of settling important difficulties, which might arise in the church.”61 A week later, on 24 February, the high council met at JS’s home to hear a report from Lyman Wight and Parley P. Pratt, envoys representing the Latter-day Saints in Missouri. When Wight and Pratt relayed the plight of their fellow exiles and expressed the desire of the Missouri Saints to return to their Jackson County properties, JS “arose and said that he was going to Zion to assist in redeeming it.”62 A revelation dated the same day instructed eight men to travel east in pairs to solicit funds and recruit volunteers for an expedition to Missouri to reinstate exiled Mormons to their homes and property. The eight “journeyed two and two in different routes.”63 The revelation appointed JS to travel with Parley P. Pratt, Lyman Wight with Sidney Rigdon, Hyrum Smith with Frederick G. Williams, and Orson Hyde with Orson Pratt.64 Journal keeping resumed in late February as JS began his journey. For the next three weeks, JS and Pratt traveled together through western Pennsylvania and New York. The missionary pairs reunited at a conference in Geneseo, New York, in mid-March.

Editorial Note
The following section of the journal, through the beginning of the entry for 14 March, was kept by Parley P. Pratt for both JS and himself as they traveled to New York. Pratt’s use of “I”—as in “I preached”—evidently refers to himself. Pratt refers to JS as “Brother Joseph” and never refers to himself in the third-person narrative voice.

18–19 April 1834 • Friday–Saturday
April 17 <​18​>, left Kirtland in company with brothers Sidney Rigdon, Oliver Cowdery , <​and​> Zebedee Coltrin for New Portage to attend a conference. Travelled to W[illiam] W. Williams’ in [p. 74] Newburgh and took dinner, after which we travelled on, and after dark were hailed by a man who desired to ride. We were checked by the Spirit and refused : he professed to be sick ; but in a few minutes was joined by two others who followed us hard, cursing and swearing , but we were successful in escaping their hands through the providence of the Lord, and stayed at a tavern where we were treated with civility. Next morning, 19 , started, and arrived at brother Joseph Bozworth’s [Bosworth’s]]  <​in​> [p. 75] Copley, Medina county , where we took dinner. Bro.  J. Bozworth  was strong in the faith — he is a good man and may, if faithful, do much good. After resting awhile, we left , and soon arrived at brother  Johnathan Tayler’s [Jonathan Taylor’s ] , in Norton, where we were received with kindness.
We soon retired to the wilderness where we united in prayer and suplication for the blessings of the Lord to be given unto his church: We called upon the Father in the name of Jesus to go with the breth[r]en who were [p. 76] going up to the land of Zion, to give brother Joseph strength , and wisdom , and understanding sufficient to lead the people of the Lord, and to gather back , and establish the saints upon the land of their inheritances, and organize them according to the will of heaven, that they be no more cast down forever.106 We then united and laid on hands: Brothers Sidney, Oliver, and Zebedee laid hands upon bro. Joseph , and confirmed upon him all the blessings necessary to qualify him to do <​stand​> before the Lord in his high calling ; and [p. 77] he return again in peace and triumph , to enjoy the society of his breth[r]en. Brothers Joseph, Sidney, and Zebedee then laid hands upon  bro. Oliver , and confirmed upon him the blessings of wisdom and understanding sufficient for his station ; that he be qualified to assist  brother Sidney in arranging the church covenants which are to be soon published ; and to have intelligence in all things to do the work of printing. Brother Joseph, Oliver, Zebedee then laid [p. 78] hands upon  bro. Sidney , and confirmed upon him the blessings of wisdom and knowledge to preside over the church in the abscence of brother Joseph, and to have the spirit to assist  bro. Oliver in conducting the Star , and to arrange the Church covenants,107 and the blessing of old age and peace , till Zion is built up & Kirtland established, till all his enemies are under his feet, and of a crown of eternal life at the <​in the​> Kingdom of God with us. [p. 79] We, Joseph, Sidney, and Oliver then laid hands upon  bro. Zebedee , and confirmed the blessing of wisdom to preach the gospel, even till is <​it​> spreads to the islands of the seas, and to be spared to see th[r]eescore years and ten, and see Zion built up and Kirtland established forever, and even at last to receive a crown of life. Our hearts rejoiced, and we were [p. 80] comforted with the Holy Spirit , Amen.

Editorial Note
JS and other volunteers of the armed expeditionary force that had been recruited for “the restoration & redemption of Zion”112 departed Ohio for Missouri on 5 May 1834. A smaller contingent started from Pontiac, Michigan, and joined them at Allred settlement, Monroe County, Missouri. After learning on 15 June that Missouri governor Daniel Dunklin would not order the state’s militia to escort the Mormons to their Jackson County lands as the Mormons had hoped, JS’s company, now numbering some two hundred, nevertheless continued their march to Clay County, Missouri. Their approach prompted negotiations between Mormons exiled from Jackson County—now living in Clay County—and Jackson County residents. Compromise proved impossible given the entrenched positions of both sides: the Mormons insisted on maintaining their rights to return to their property and refused to sell, and Jacksonites refused to have the Mormons live among them. Local residents also prepared for armed confrontation with the advancing Mormons. When questioned about his intentions, JS disavowed any military offensive, and no armed confrontation materialized.
In mid-June a cholera epidemic began to make inroads among JS’s company. On 22 June, JS announced a revelation postponing the redemption of Zion “for a little season.” Zion would be redeemed only after the Latter-day Saints purchased additional land in Jackson County and vicinity; after their leading elders were “endowed with power from on high” in Ohio; and after the Mormons in Missouri found “favor in the eyes of the people, until the armies of Israel become very great.”113 Thus JS maintained long-term hopes for a temporarily failed enterprise. The cholera-decimated Mormon troops were dispersed and soon discharged to remain in Clay County or—in most cases—to return eastward to their homes. JS organized a standing high council for the Missouri Mormons and selected a number of Missouri church leaders to be endowed in the House of the Lord then under construction in Kirtland. JS and other members of the Camp of Israel expedition, which later became known as Zion’s Camp, returned to Ohio in early August. While JS did not keep a personal record during this time, he assigned Frederick G. Williams to send periodic reports of their journey to Oliver Cowdery in Kirtland.114 However, no such reports have survived. JS later oversaw the creation of a history that drew on others’ accounts to create a narrative of the journey.115
In the wake of the failure to effect a return of Mormon refugees to Jackson County, the Latter-day Saints’ highest priorities became completing the construction of their temple in Kirtland and purchasing land in the vicinity of Jackson County. Both endeavors were understood to be prerequisites to returning to their Zion; both would impose great financial burdens.
21 August 1834 • Thursday
 August 21st 1834. This day brother Frederick [G.] Williams returned from Cleveland and told us concerning the plague,116 and after much consultation we agreed that  bro. Frederick should go to Cleveland and commence administering to the sick, for the purpose of obtaining means <​blessings for them , and​> for the work of <​glory of​> the Lord : 117 Accordingly, we, Joseph, Frederick, and Oliver [Cowdery] united in prayer before the Lord for this thing. [p. 85]
Now, O Lord, grant unto us this <​those​> blessing<​s​> , in the name of Jesus Christ, and thy name shall have the glory forever ; Amen.

Editorial Note
On 5 September 1834, JS left Kirtland with Oliver Cowdery to attend a conference of elders in New Portage, Ohio.120 In the second half of October, JS was again away from Kirtland, this time to visit the Latter-day Saints in Pontiac, Michigan. When in Kirtland, he continued to work on the church’s printing concerns and on building the House of the Lord.121
On the evening of 28 November 1834, the day before this journal resumes, JS attended a high council meeting and heard from members of the Tippets family, who were en route to Missouri. In response to a December 1833 revelation that instructed church branches to “gather to gether all their monies” and send “honorable men” to purchase lands in Jackson County, the church in Lewis, New York, had sent the Tippetses with a letter to JS and $848.40 in donations of cash and property. The high council recommended that the migrants winter in Kirtland and requested temporary financial help from them. John Tippets and Caroline Tippets lent $430, to be paid back in the spring when they would resume their journey.122 This short-term financial assistance brought renewed hope and prompted the recording of prayers and resolutions.
29 November 1834 • Saturday
November 29. 1834. This evening Joseph and Oliver [Cowdery] united in prayer for the continuance of blessings, after giving thanks for the relief which the Lord had lately sent us by opening the hearts of certain brethren from the east to loan us $430.
After conversing and rejoicing before the Lord on this occasion we agreed to enter into the following covenant with the Lord, viz: =
That if the Lord will [p. 87]
prosper us in our business , and open the way before <​us​> that we may obtain means to pay our debts, that we be not troubled nor brought into disrepute before the world nor his people, that after that of all that he shall give us we will give a tenth, to be bestowed upon the poor in his church, or as he shall command , and that we will be faithful over that which he has entrusted to our care and that we [p. 88]
may obtain much : and that our children after us shall remember to observe this sacred and holy covenant : after us: And that our children and our children’s may know of the same we here subscribe our names with our own hands before the Lord:
Joseph Smith Jr
Oliver Cowdery.123
And now, O Father, as thou didst prosper our father Jacob , and bless [p. 89] him with protection and prosperity where ever he went from the time he made a like covenant before and with thee ; and as thou didst ,— even the same night , open the heavens unto him and manifest great mercy and favor , and give him promises,124 so wilt thou do by us his sons ; and as his blessings prevailed above the blessings of his Progenitors into the utmost bounds of the [p. 90] everlasting hills,125 even so may our blessings prevail above <​like​> his ; and may thy servants be preserved from the power and influence of wicked and unrighteous men; may every weapon formed against us fall upon the head of him who shall form it;126 may we be blessed with a name and a place among thy saints here , and thy sanctified when they shall rest. Amen. [p. 91]
30 November 1834 • Sunday
Sabbath evening, November 30, 1834. While reflecting upon the goodness and mercy of the Lord , this evening, a prophecy was put into our hearts , that in a short time the Lord would arrange his providences in a merciful manner and send us assistance to deliver us from debt and bondage.127 [p. 92]
5 December 1834 • Friday
Friday Evening, December 5, 1834. According to the directions of the Holy Spirit breth[r]en Joseph Smith jr. Sidney [Rigdon], Frederick G. Williams, and Oliver Cowdery , assembled to converse upon the welfare of the church, when brother Oliver Cowdery was ordained an assistant  President  of the  High and Holy Priesthood  under the hands of brother Joseph Smith jr. Saying, “My brother, in the name of Jesus Christ who died was crucified for the sins of the world, I lay my hands upon thee , and ordain thee an assistant President 128 of the high and holy p[r]iesthood in the church of the Latter Day Saints [p. 93]

Editorial Note
Except for a few notes jotted in the back, this journal ends with the preceding 5 December 1834 entry. “Chapter 1” of JS’s 1834–1836 history consisted of a narrative in journal format for 5 and 6 December 1834, recorded by Oliver Cowdery; but that approach was then terminated.129 Not until late September 1835, nearly ten months later, did JS again keep a journal. Two priorities loomed in the intervening months: the redemption of Zion in Missouri and building a House of the Lord in Kirtland for the promised endowment of power. During the interim, JS also expanded church leadership by forming the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and another organization called the Quorum of the Seventy, responsible for traveling and preaching. Men who had served in the expedition to Missouri made up most of the initial membership of both entities. When JS’s journal keeping resumed, it was more persistent, resulting in a coherent six-month narrative leading up to and including the empowerment in the House of the Lord in Kirtland, which the Latter-day Saints understood to be a prerequisite for the redemption of Zion.
The final three pages of this journal contain notes related to the events recorded in preceding journal entries. Subscriptions to The Evening and the Morning Star that were evidently solicited during JS’s 26 February–28 March 1834 mission are recorded on these pages. Following the subscriptions, a note was inscribed, apparently in preparation for the conference held 20–21 April 1834 at Norton, Ohio.
