Book 3, 15 July 1843–29 February 1844
Editorial Note
Willard Richards’s third memorandum book records JS’s continued participation in various business, legal, civic, and ecclesiastical affairs in 1843 and early 1844. JS’s involvement in both local and national politics, especially after being nominated as a presidential candidate in January 1844, figures prominently in the record, as does his continued concern about his enemies in Missouri and the Saints’ efforts to obtain redress for losses they had earlier suffered there. Richards also recorded several of JS’s public discourses and noted the beginning of his efforts to find a new place in the West where church members could gather—efforts that would take on added significance when the Council of Fifty, organized in March 1844, took oversight of the project. Prominent, too, in this book are JS’s estrangement from William Law and his difficulties with Sidney Rigdon. Against a backdrop of court cases, visits to the theater, city council meetings, and other activities, Richards also recorded numerous meetings in which ordinances and teachings that would later be performed and taught in the Nauvoo temple were given to select individuals.

A faithful discharge of my official duties. was all that I attempted or desir[e]d. very respetfuly [respectfully] your obt Sevt.

Joseph preacheed funeral sermon of Gen James Adams.—237 All men know that all men must die.— What is the object of our coming into existence. then dying and falling away to be here no more? This is a subject we ought to study more than any other, which we ought to study day and night.— If we have any claim on our heavenly father for any thing it is for knowledge on this important subject— could we read and comprehend all that has been writtn from the days of Adam on the relation of man to God & angels. and the spirits of Just men in a future state. we should know very little about it. could you gaze in heaven 5 minute. you would know more— than you possibly would can know by read[ing] all that ever was writtn on the subject. We are one only capable of comprehedig [comprehending] that certain things exist. which we may acquire by certain fixed principles— If men would acquire salvation they have got to be subj[e]ct to certain rules. & principle which were fixed by an unalterable dercee [decree] before the world was. before they leave this wo[r]ld. what did they learn by coming to the spirits of just men made perfect?238 is it written. No!
The spir[i]ts of just men are made ministering servants to those who are sealed unto life eternal. & it is through them that the sealing power comes down— The spirit of Patriarch adams now is <​now of​> the spirits of the just men made [perfect?]— and if revealed now. must be revealed in fire. And the glory could not be endured— Jesus. shewed himself to his disciples [p. [121]] and they thought it was his a his spirit. & they were afr[a]id to approach his spirit.239 Angels have advanced higher in knowledge & power than Spirits
Judge Adams had some enemies, but such a man ought not to have had an enemy. I saw him first at springfield. when on my way from Mo [Missouri] to Washington.240 he sought me out when a stranger. took me to his house. encoura[ge]d & cheered me & give me money— when men are prepared. they are better off to go hence.— Bro Adams has gone to open up a more effectual door for the dead.—
Flesh and blood cannot go there but flesh and bones quickened by the Spirit of God can
If we would be sober. & watch in fasting and prayer. God would tu[r]n away sickness from our midst. Hasten the work of the temple. and all the work of the Last Days. Let the elders & sai[n]ts do away light mi[n]dedness and be sober.—

Editorial Note
On 19 October, JS asked William Clayton to accompany him to Ramus, Illinois. As they traveled to Ramus later that day, JS mentioned that Emma Smith had “turned quite friendly & kind”—an indirect reference to the tensions JS and Emma had experienced the previous July and August over plural marriage.265 JS also told Clayton that Emma had recently received significant temple-related ordinances. JS spent the night of 19 October at Benjamin F. Johnson’s house in Ramus and, on the following evening, gave a discourse on “the advantages of the E. C. [everlasting covenant]” of eternal marriage, a topic he had addressed with Johnson and his wife, Melissa LeBaron Johnson, in May 1843. “He said there was two seals in the Priesthood,” Clayton recorded. “The first was that which was placed upon a man and woman when they made the covenant & the other was the seal which alloted to them their particular mansion.” Following JS’s discourse, “Johnson & his wife were united in an everlasting covenant.”266
JS and Clayton returned to Nauvoo at two o’clock in the afternoon on 21 October. Willard Richards, unaware of JS’s departure to Ramus until 20 October, continued to make notations in JS’s journal but did not indicate JS’s presence in Nauvoo until 22 October.
